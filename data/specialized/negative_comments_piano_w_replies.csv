You’re not wrong about the flaws of upvoting, but my post takes issue with the language used in OP’s post and the messaging. Critiquing people for posting videos of them playing the piano “badly” is non-supportive to people interested in learning our wonderful instrument.

If people are upvoting videos of beginners learning classical music and experts playing popular pieces, then that’s where the subreddit is headed and you can be upset if that’s not inline with what you want see. But don’t shame beginners for posting videos or being drawn to popular classical pieces. In my eyes, the more people playing the piano the better and even though people are drawn in by popular classical musical this is likely just the start of their journey. If we support them here, one day they may find themselves bored of the popular classical pieces and will explore the wonderful and historic depths of classical piano music. 

We will not get more people learning and exploring the instrument if we tell people “play something different or get out”.",1597414422,"'We will not get more people learning and exploring the instrument if we tell people “play something different or get out”.'

That is true. But on the flip side, you will eventually not have any more experienced players willing to discuss things and give advice on this sub if it's only the same 10 posts/questions every day. It gets boring and it's not like anyone is being paid to do it.
