t1_glknke9,-1,t3_l9qq6v,LoganNolag,photography,"I agree.

Lens caps annoy me so I don't really use them except for storage. I just put a clear/uv filter on all my lenses and call it a day.

ND Filters: YES PLEASE BUILD THEM INTO THE CAMERA BODY!!!!!!!!! Sony already does this on a lot of their professional e-mount video cameras. This is the number one most desirable missing feature for me.

Screw Driver's/Hex tools. I don't really do much tripod shooting but when I do I understand what you're talking about. If I did a lot of tripod work I would just leave my arca swiss brackets on all the time.

Large Touchscreens. Not a huge deal for me since I mostly use the viewfinder but I would have no issue with bigger/better screens. Really the only screen related thing I care about is that for some reason companies are still not putting fully articulating screens on all of their cameras. See Sony Alpha 1 for a perfect example of this.

Wifi Transfer etc. Again not a huge deal for me since I just do photography mostly as a hobby so I just transfer my photos when my card fills up but it would be nice to be able to more easily share them without needing a computer. I would love it if the camera companies would build cellular connectivity directly into the cameras so you can email photos directly from them instead of sending them through a phone or computer.

Finally I have one additional annoyance and this one is probably the biggest problem I have with interchangeable lens cameras: **DUST**. I don't know why after almost 30 years of DSLRs/Mirrorless cameras companies still don't have good antidust solutions. Also pretty much every company says not to clean the sensor yourself and makes it really hard to clean without risking damaging the sensor. I really wish they would add a layer of more durable glass farther away from the sensor so that dust will be less visible and easier to clean. If they were really good they could use this protective glass as the ND filter.",1612163195,,

So it isn't generally distasteful/amateurish if your subject's 2nd eye is blurried, or their ears or hair is blurried?",1601851494,"My advice is to not concern yourself with the concept of ""generally distasteful"".  Your photography isn't decided by committee.  The photos are yours. Everyone else is just along for the ride. Or not, if that's the case.

I find exaggerated colours/HDR style photography to be personally distasteful. I don't like it and skip over it when I see it. But that shouldn't deter anyone else if that's what appeals to them.  

One of the quickest ways to kill your own creativity is to ask others what they like and try to fit in.  It's one of the downsides to critique.  Often, peoples will just offer advice to make your photos more like theirs.  If that advice is taken wholesale, the photos end up being homogenised.  That's fine if you want your photos to look like someone else's.  But my advice would be to do your own thing.

Try new things. Try the stuff you don't like and see if you can make it work for you.  Your photography, your taste. And your taste will probably change over time, btw. So that's another reason not to get too entrenched into views about what's a good or bad approach to taking photos.

When it comes to your photography the only opinion on shallow depth of field that matters is your own.  If you're on the fence about it, take the photo twice with different settings and see which you prefer. If you you flat out love/hate it, then do/don't use it as you see fit.

Technique is a hard one. I would say that the goal is to become proficient enough that you dont think about the technicalities of a photo. You just do it. So you do need to learn it but then not worry about it so much. It's very easy to become bogged down in f-stops, shutter speeds etc. But what really matters, imo, is what's happening in front of the camera.  The depth of field is only part of the bigger picture. If removing it or adding it kills your enthusiasm for the photo, there is likely something else missing from the photo.  Your technique shouldn't be the main attraction. 

Technically complex shoots eg studio shoots are different.  You need to know what's happening with your equipment at all times. But if your taking about street or natural light stuff then there are better things to concern yourself with than depth of field.  All in my opinion, of course.",7
t1_g7tdlzz,-1,t3_j5hex1,LukeOnTheBrightSide,photography,"You might already know this, but IBIS only helps with stationary subjects. With the exception of my neighbor's toddler who loves sitting still and watching golf, kids normally don't qualify. ;) Having stabilized lenses can provide a lot of the same benefit.

IBIS is great, it just doesn't help in *every* situation, that's all.

> I will use multiple lens, but I will pick out one before I go out and shoot based on what im gonna do. I need at least a APS-C sensor. Low light is important.

Hmm. Fuji's supposedly going to announce that new camera sometime soonish, but I'd wait for reviews of it. That said, Fuji has a great set of compact f/2 primes - 23mm f/2, 35mm f/2, and 50mm f/2. They're all fast, internally focusing, weather sealed, compact, and have aperture rings. No stabilization, though, so maybe a Fuji body with IBIS + those lenses would fit your ""small camera and pick a prime"" preference, although I don't think Fuji's IBIS is considered class-leading.

Oh, if you're willing to give *just a bit* in sensor size, some micro 4/3 system cameras were known for having truly fantastic IBIS. I've heard the smaller sensors made stabilization more effective, but I'm no engineer.

Sony's also a great choice, and probably has the best AF / image performance for what you're looking for. I'd try to hold a camera in-person if you can do so safely - some people love the ergonomics of Sony's A6x00 lineup, some people hate them.",1601923581,Thanks for the detailed reply!

So you don't even bother asking you just barge in and start putting your hands on people? Seems like the polite thing to do would be to at least first get verbal consent that you're going to touch someone to reposition them.

If a model is going to freak out because you gently repositioned their arm after first warning them that you were going to reposition their arm, then *holy shit, you shouldn't be shooting with that model.*

Yes, obviously you need to be sensitive to the fact that the person is naked and in a vulnerable position, and you should be super-duper professional, keep touching to an absolute minimum and far away from the delicate bits, use touch as a last resort if verbal direction isn't getting the job done, etc., but if the model isn't comfortable enough with you to let you touch her elbow, then the problem is her comfort level, not the elbow touching.",6

 You “can” increase the shutter speed of a FF camera with a f/5.6 lens just as much as with an APS-C camera with a f/3.7 lens and get the same DoF and noise (assuming similar sensor technology, which is generally the case with modern cameras).   


Correct, faster has only to do with aperture as the term predates digital when changing iso was a matter of film so increasing the size of the aperture one stop from f/4 to f/2.8 allowed you to double your shutter speed.  


So no f/5.6 on FF needs to be f/3.7 on APS-C, that only applies to depth of field or else the calculations on f/stop relative to iso and shutter speed would need to be varied for every possible sensor size.  


5.6 on medium format has within manufacturing tolerances the same exposure value as 5.6 on full frame as as on an APS-C  


Sensor generation has nothing to do with any exposure math, now if you had a full frame and aps-c from the same manufacturer using the same sensor tech and released within a year of each other the full frame would have less noise at a given iso.  


Tl;dr Exposure value stays the same regardless of sensor size",1583104371,"> So no f/5.6 on FF needs to be f/3.7 on APS-C, that only applies to depth of field or else the calculations on f/stop relative to iso and shutter speed would need to be varied for every possible sensor size.

The calculation is simple. If format A has *n*× the linear size of format B, then A gets equivalent images to B by using the same shutter speed, *n*× the focal length, *n*× the f-number and *n*²× the ISO setting. It will be equivalent in field of view, image brightness, noise, diffraction and depth of field. It’s not black magic.

So, whatever you get on APS-C at 50mm f/2 1/100s and ISO 100, for example, you could get on full frame at 75mm f/3 1/100s and ISO 225.

> Sensor generation has nothing to do with any exposure math, now if you had a full frame and aps-c from the same manufacturer using the same sensor tech and released within a year of each other the full frame would have less noise at a given iso.

Indeed, and why is that, according to you? :)

> Tl;dr Exposure value stays the same regardless of sensor size

Focal plane exposure yes. But that’s not what matters to the final image, it’s practically irrelevant when comparing different formats. Neither is the number of the ISO setting used. It’s not film photography anymore, you don’t have to choose your ISO speed first and then use a sufficient exposure for your film to be developable. You can set your exposure first (according to your DoF and motion freezing needs) and only then set the ISO (or let the camera do it automatically). Imagine that!",2

t1_eykit0m,-2,t3_cxc0of,toomanybeersies,photography,"I'm going to go against the grain here and say that just because you have rights doesn't mean you're obliged to exercise them, and doing so can cause you more problems than it solves.

Refusing to allow the police to view the photos on your camera and only answering the bare minimum required by law isn't going to make your life easier. And if you ask if you're being detained, and they say you aren't, then walking off isn't going to make your life easier.

In my opinion, you did the right thing (as far as avoiding trouble goes). Explain your situation, tell them your kid's on the team, and get someone else you know (the assistant principal) to vouch for you. They were gonna file a report regardless.

Upon saying that, it never hurts to at least clarify and confirm your rights. Cops have a habit of saying things that are ambiguous (""you need to stay here"" is not the same as ""you are being detained""). Nothing wrong with asking what your rights are: ""just to clarify, am I being detained?"" or ""do you require my consent to search my camera?"". Also, even if they assert that they have a legal basis to search your camera, you don't have to consent to it, ""I do not consent to a search, but I will comply"" will keep you out of trouble, and will also cover you if the search was considered illegal (if for some reason it got to court or something).

From the cops perspective, they've probably had some hysterical parent ring them complaining about a pervert taking photos of the cheerleaders (no shit it's a football game), and cops have to deal with all sorts of shit every day so they're often pretty highly strung.

Clamming up and asserting your rights won't make them just stop and go away. There's every potential for them to make some mental gymnastics about probable cause, and arrest you for taking pictures up cheerleaders skirts. Doesn't mean you'd get charged or go to court, or that you're guilty, but they'd still possibly be in their rights.

Now that this has happened, my suggestion for the future would be to make sure that a senior staff member knows you're doing photography at the game (and direct the cops to them if they turn up again), and get a written letter from that staff member ""authorising"" you to take photos. Shit like that makes your life that little bit easier.",1567153931,A right unexercised is a right lost.

Are kids really just so irresistibly sexual that there can be no other valid reason to photograph them? Or is it far more likely that most people don't actually view them that way at all? In a panic to protect kids from being sexualized, people are labeling them as sex objects, thereby creating the very situation they are obsessing over.

All that lighting equipment has to be lugged around to the shoots and set up.

t1_f35twi0,-1,t3_dfc8n4,shpinxian,photography," Sure, anything below AF-D doesn't even give you focus confirmation and the AF-D lenses lack AF. Let's go back before 1983 when Nikon introduced AF, I'm sure that's just a passing trend just like mirrorless. 

Not to mention that even if you're into something like landscape photography, where you can easily live without AF, the optical performance is still horrendous on modern cameras in terms of abberations, especially LoCA, muddy corners, flare...

And if that doesn't scare you away... you're going to have a hard time finding equivalent focal lengths for APS-C cameras. Want a 24-70? Nope, the closest you could get with old D lenses is a 17-35mm or 18-35mm, leaving you with a 35mm gap until you can get a nice 70-200mm... I wonder why nobody builds 26-50mm lenses anymore. 

But heaven forbid any potential customers get annoyed when Nikon pulls the same shit as they did with their DX DSLRs again. What's next? We get a 16-55mm f2.8 ""pro zoom"" which will struggle with sensor resolutions from 5-6 years after launch but is never updated for 16 years, whereas third parties offer an optically equal performer for 1/4th the price? It's already cheaper to buy a Z6+24-70/4+FTZ kit compared to the D500 with the 17-55/2.8 and about equal if you replace the D500 with the D7500. The Z6 kit is just 50€ more than the D500+16-80/2.8-4 kit.... but sure Nikon, go ahead and release a 900$ body with a kit lens with worse specs as your sub-400$ entry-level DSLR, I'm sure people will be thrilled.",1570690635,,

I wasn't arguing that the value was in the cost of buying one softbox.  You have no idea what kind of photo OP is referring to if you think mall santa with a softbox is relevant (and you think the softbox isn't even necessary because mall lighting is enough).

OP wasn't in the mall.  Again, you're missing the point of these highly stylized christmas shoots.  OP's photographer is not competing with thermal-printed shots at the mall for $8.

Luxury goods are still advertised somewhere.  Replace magazine with airport wall display.  Or wherever you're going to see high fashion, fragrances, and jewelry advertised--I guarantee you it's not a pop-up ad.  Magazine cover was just an example.

When you have a product that gets you 80% of the way there for free, or alternately, a product that gets you 100% of the way there for *$400*, what do you think the market is going to do?

The difference gets especially glaring when you consider what exactly the photographer is using to justify their exorbitant costs.
