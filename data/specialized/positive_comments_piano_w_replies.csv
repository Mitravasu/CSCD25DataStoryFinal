t1_fm3l3kj,297,t3_fstqve,iamunknowntoo,piano,"Hey guys, I think this is called the Improvised Fantasy by Shopang I think, it's around like a standard Grade 2 ABRSM piece at most, pretty typical of a beginner. The next piece you should try is probably La Mozzarella by List, it's Grade 5 I think, shouldn't be too hard.

Jokes aside, pretty awesome playing. Might want to make the left hand a tad bit lighter though. Also there's a really great masterclass about Fantaisie-Impromptu which really gets into the dynamics/musicality of the piece, which I found very informative: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIxiMaREH2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIxiMaREH2U)

Also the tone of your piano is perhaps a bit too ""harsh"", though I know there's only so much any player can get out of an upright piano compared to a grand piano. Here's a tutorial on how to get a [better tone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dhNCeMC4X8) out of your piano.",1585727374,I didn‚Äôt even get to the slow part!

So, I'm assuming you're self taught. The reason why I'm telling this is because I see a lot of technique problems. The rendition of the piece in itself is not ""bad"" (even if you still have work to do), but these technique problems will come back and haunt you if you don't fix them now that you're a beginner. They will prevent you from playing properly more difficult pieces, and some of them can also cause injuries.

First, and most important: rhythm. You need to be able to play this piece maybe at a slower pace, but without changes in rhythm. In this video you suddenly accelerate, then you slow down, then you accelerate again, and so on and so forth. Sometimes you even skip beats (e.g. at 0:41), some other times you just add extra bars/beats that aren't in the score (e.g. 1:20 and following). Use the metronome. Your rhythm needs to be steady and regular. You can ""rubato"" later, once you can play the piece at a steady pace.

Second: finger/hand/wrist posture and movements. You're doing something very wrong with your left hand at 0:05 and the other similar passages in the piece: you're rotating your whole hand and wrist to get your index finger to pass above your thumb. That's a big no. Not only it's inefficient (you can't do that movement quickly enough when you'll need to do the same in faster pieces), but it can also be dangerous. You just need to let your finger pass above the thumb without that hand/wrist movement. Also, in many passages there seem to be some tension in your hand: that's a recipe for fatigue or even tendinitis in the long run. Relax your whole arm and try to not put tension while playing.

Third: articulation, polishing and overall cleaning of the piece. It's clear that some passages are a bit difficult for you, but you need to play all the notes and make them sound ""clean"". My teacher used to say that they should be like ""pearls on a necklace"". Sometimes your notes are muffled instead (from 0:35 to 0:52), or you just pause a bit to get them right, breaking the rhythm like hiccups (e.g. 1:41 and following). In certain passages you changed or skipped the notes altogether because they were to be played too fast and you couldn't keep up (0:43). This is really something you need to work on.

You clearly have passion and potential, but you should *really* take care of your technique, otherwise you'll go nowhere. :/ My advice is to get a teacher: they can really fix your problems, and the sooner the better, because the more you play like this, the more these technique issues will become bad habits very difficult to eradicate later.

Hope this can be of help. Keep practicing... the right way! ;)",1592403244,"Wow, from time to time I am surprised at how people on reddit take their time to help others, thanks. 
1. Rhythm - I believe it was my bad, I on purpose was accelerating and decelerating here and there, I probably should not do that.
2. 0:05 moment. I felt there is something wrong with how my hand looks like but I thought this should be the way. Now I know it's actually wrong
3. My initial plan was to learn three pieces in three months and then focus on reading notes. I probably missed or added some notes due to not being able to correctly follow tutorials.

I'm planning on to get a teacher, do you think conservatoire student as a teacher is okay?",64

t1_gbquytx,122,t3_jr0vm5,bottom_of_the_key,piano,"Great :) First of all, I want to tell you that it sounds very beautiful. By only this 24 seconds, I can understand your great taste and musicality. Timing is perfect for your musical intention, by the way, and that's very difficult to achieve in Rachmaninov's music.

First, I think it would be perfect if you try to get rid of the accents, in general. For example, Two bars before the climax, you're giving (for me) too much importance to every high B note, which drowns the original long chord and breaks the long line as a consequence. I'm sure the arrival of the climax would be much stronger without this break. Then, during the climax, try not to push too hard the first of every two 8th notes, especially the first voice. I'm noticing a slight tendency towards accents every half a bar, try to make everything flow as forward as you can. Long lines always! There are no accents written, just long slurs comprising each motive, try to feel them deeply :)  


Then, on a technical level, your fingers work great in these quick notes. But I think, when you have fff chords, it would help that, instead of pushing the keys downwards somewhat harshly  (look at your hands in the very last chord you play in the video, or at the octave basses in the right hand), try to perform deeper movements, releasing your wrist and your arms upwards after you play, and feeling the bottom of each key under your fingers. You can practice this by learning the first chords of Tchaikovsky's first Concerto, because you'll find that movement isolated and easy to practice. That will make your sound louder, deeper and even more beautiful.

And one last question about the pedal: is it a conscious decision to release it just before hitting chords in order to create a micropause before them? Because to me it seems that this way of pedalling contributes to a harsher sound and, again, it breaks the line. Maybe with a deeper touch this could work, but even having in mind that the situation of the camera/microphone isn't ideal to analyse resonance, something sounds slightly odd to me. You can try to connect the harmonies more with the pedal. But this is, again, a personal point of view. I hate giving advice about pedal to people at this high level, because it is very personal and dependant on the touch and musical intention.

Let me know what do you think of all this. Your feedback to this comment will also make me improve my way of expressing ideas :)

Cheers and keep up the good work!",1604948474,"Thank you so much üôèüèº I highly appreciate this elaborate comment.

t1_fzuh2dp,59,t3_i11wcf,mittenciel,piano,"Overall, good, but first of all, you should learn to be happy with your progress while not necessarily considering your work to be almost perfect because I think there's no such thing, especially for Bach. This is a piece that even top concert pianists will continue to practice because there's just so much to discover and rediscover here.

Toward the end, your pedal got sloppy and you weren't properly releasing it at the end of every measure. You should be pedaling twice per measure anyway, on the 1 and the 3. I actually prefer releasing on the 2 and 4 a lot of the time. Otherwise, it builds too much for my tastes. Your current pedaling sounds especially muddy on Measure 23.

Also, does your score really have you playing in the treble clef on Measure 33? I've never heard that before. If your score says that, your score is wrong. It should be an octave lower. In addition, what I often hear pianists do on those two measures is to use very little pedal at all to establish a different tonality. That's also what I personally do. Do you have to play it that way? No, not really.

Moreover, now that you've learned the notes and you feel comfortable with them, you should try to bring out the lyricism of the piece. This progression in this Prelude is absolutely gorgeous and there's so much tension and resolution going on. Adding dynamics will help you achieve that and so will subtle tempo variations. As Bach didn't write dynamics for WTC, you'll have to figure out what they should be. I also think you could speed it up a tiny bit and try to invoke the feeling of motion, rather than being so static. Even if you don't speed it up, you'll notice that when great pianists play this piece, the note lengths are pretty much never steady. Almost every pianist will make the bass note more expressive and louder and take up more space, and will tend to take a breath before the treble notes come in. This breath changes depending on the chord and can range from barely perceptible to a deep breath.

Exploring these variations and putting one's own flavor on it is the reason why pianists return to this piece year after year.",1596187756,Can‚Äôt blame him his not on a piano a keyboard is never comparable,5

You. Are. Not. A. Waste. Of. Time. 

I‚Äôve seen my students go through divorces, bad grades, losing jobs, moving, being bullied, depression, anxiety, broken bones, and open heart surgeries. This list keeps going. 

There are teachers who will recognize these struggles in their students and choose to put the music above the person and continue with doing their job. I respect that *and* I disagree with that approach. 

If you have a personal rapport with your teacher and if they seem like they put the *person* above the music instead, please talk to them and at the very least just let them know. They should know how to work with you through this. 

While I guard a personal boundary that I‚Äôm not a mental health professional, I exercise my compassion with deep care in my practice. I understand that learning piano is a demanding and a challenging task. I also understand that you‚Äôre a human being doing the best that she can given all of the circumstances. 

Please don‚Äôt feel guilty or ashamed. Piano can be such an all-encompassing healing process. It‚Äôs not all about the practice. 

I wish I could speak more love into you. Take good care of yourself.",1611767824,"I want to second this comment, and add an anecdote.

I have an adult student who NEVER practices, but shows up every week. He has a genuine interest in piano, and we always have something to work on.  The progress is very slow, but he's still learning. I don't pressure him to practice because he will when he's ready.

In my studio all that matters is that you enjoy learning about music and you come ready to learn. I work entirely with amateurs. You're not in a conservatory preparing to become a professional.

The only time I would ever encourage someone to quit their lessons is if they've lost their interest entirely, which is evident in the lesson regardless of whether or not the student practices.

Don't let a leisurely activity steal your joy. It's not worth putting pressure on yourself. Life provides plenty of things to worry about, and your weekly piano lessons shouldn't be one of them.",7

t1_gdm7nsu,20,t3_k15svj,PianoUnlocked,piano,"If you're asking in terms of what is helpful in building a pianist's technique, I can say I got my technique entirely through exercises: Pischna, Dohnanyi, Joseffy, and Creston for muscle-building, finger independence, and specific techniques such as thirds and sixths; Czerny op. 299 for speed; Hanon for evenness of tone; Brahms for close intervals.

In terms of what concert etudes are important to the repertoire and their difficulty: the Chopin etudes are tremendously difficult--more so in many cases than the Liszt etudes. The Liszt 3 Concert Etudes (particularly #2 and #3) and the 2 Concert Etudes are repertoire staples. Some of the Transcendental Etudes (Harmonies du Soir, Mazeppa, Paysage) are frequently programmed. The Debussy Etudes are marvelous and not programmed enough. Of more contemporary etudes, the Ligeti etudes are highly established.

But unless you're auditioning for a conservatory program or competition that requires an etude in your audition package, you should feel free to program or not program etudes based entirely on whether the music moves you. Many concert pianists have specific areas of repertoire that they focus on, and if you're playing concert-level repertoire, it's just understood that you have the technique needed to play professionally regardless of whether you include etudes in your repertoire.

Please let me know if you'd like me to clarify anything or would like to discuss further.",1606356254,"Wow this was literally perfect thank you for the response. I'm just looking to build up technique at the moment. I just started with some of Hanons etudes and bachs WTC and was just looking for some other staple etudes I should learn. A pianist friend of mine told me that if I really want to improve my technique and get really good I should focus on completing the majority of Chopin's etudes. I'm an above avrage pianist and could play some of his easier etudes. Yet I've been on the fence about attempting them. Do you think Chopin's etudes are really that important in building up technique?

That's still sound advice, but the problem is that this absolute dumpster fire of a notation job makes it nearly impossible for someone to tell where the beat even is.  There's terrible beaming and way too much of that ""not quite a triplet"" notation everywhere.

To be honest, if I were going to try to learn something this relatively dense for real... I would end up re-editing the whole thing so that it was actually legible because as is there's almost no way to really read it it in any real fashion.  

You *could* try drawing veritcal lines over the top of the downbeats to help you figure out where the left and right hands line up and just count and subdivide... but honestly, that would just be so difficult with this.

- This was recorded on an iPhone 6S. This is the best audio quality I‚Äôve ever gotten from recording a piano. 

- The difference between this and a baby grand or an upright is night and day. This was the first piano the sales rep introduced me to that day lmao and that was a mistake because all the other ones she showed me were immediately inferior. 

- It felt like the piano was playing me more than I was playing it. I felt so shitty with myself for the mistakes I made in this short performance (of which there are many). Playing on a piano never felt more natural. 

- For anyone curious about this study: A man named Leopold Godowsky made a set of 54 Studies based on Frederic Chopin‚Äôs Op.10, Op.25, and Nouvelle √©tudes, expanding on technique for the left hand of which there wasn‚Äôt much in the original √©tude (the one exception being Op.25 No.7, which I think we can all agree is plenty good for left hand technique lol). The opinions on these studies are polarizing, with some saying they are innovative and creatively expand on Chopin‚Äôs works while others say they abuse his works, make them unmusical, and use his namesake as promotion for these studies. Personally, I find these studies to be **incredibly** beautiful, and I hope anyone and everyone reading this feel empowered to look into them further! :)

OP, please correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like the kid is doing a mix of reading the song from the music and listening to what the speakers play before he commits to more difficult intervals. It's much more apparent after Megalovania breaks away from the intro that he's less familiar with that part, and thus struggles more. He fixes his errors quickly, which I think is a sign of a good ear. Nothing to scoff at, either! But a bit more reasonable.",1568241229,"Both and.....

The intro was also featured in one of the previous lessons in the app (in the video he's just doing free play), so that's why this comes easier to him.

When he starts to learn a new song, he starts with the ""full song"", with no practice lessons.

He then sees how far he gets before getting stuck. Usually he plays through the whole song with all the errors but just keeps on going until the end.

Then he chooses if he just needs to do the same some more, or if he needs to practice some specific parts in the practice mode (where they are played slowly, note by note without music at first, and broken down in like intro, chorus, bridge etc.).

And yes - he sight reads. On a scary level for a 7-year old beginner. I can see it when he plays pieces he doesn't know beforehand, and when he digs in to my old analogue sheet music collection. Always from start to end to get to know the flow and rhythm, before refining the individual parts.

But his advantage is maybe, that he is just 7....... He thinks he's the best at everything he does (and if not, then he will be), and he's not embarrassed if he plays something wrong. Much unlike his 13-year old brother (also beginner) who plays a couple of notes at a time (of course with headphones on) until they are perfect, before he adds the next. It can take him a week until he gets to the last note in a song. And even longer before he takes off the headphones for us to hear.",2

The second concerto is the one which is closest to the classical concerto of Mozart and Haydn, so I would not recommend you to play that one. 

However, this is mostly based on my opinion, and therefore should be taken with a grain of salt. What I am really wondering though, is how you can hate the Beethoven concerto's all equally? In my opinion, the later concerts of Beethoven really classify in the 'romantic' period, in which I would also put Rach concerti 1, 2 and 3 (although Rach of course might be more 'late' romantic). Especially the fifth concerto has that grandiose vibe which I would also describe to the second concert of Rach",1593545838,"I don't know about this. All of Beethoven's concerti, including the 5th are very classical in feel. Grandiose? Maybe, but there is far less integration between the piano and orchestra than in a true Romantic concerto.

I'm also guilty of giving fairly absolutist advice (usually in response to a specific situation question).

What I wish more people could learn, and more teachers could be clear about, is that certain ideas are context dependent.

Things like playing through mistakes is a great example.  Some teachers say never stop and keep going.  Some teachers say never let a mistake go unchecked.  Both are correct, but require critical thinking to know under which circumstance to apply each.


The same can be said for use of the metronome (always and never tend to be terrible advice). 

---

I agree strongly with many of your commandments, but then find myself disagree with just as many.  No extraneous motion may be a good rule of thumb and people shouldn't flail about in an attempt to look more musical than they are being for pure flair... but so long as you're not letting your movement interfere with the efficiency of motion that's directly applied to playing the instrument, it's not really a problem.  In fact, there are plenty of times I would find it very difficult to *NOT* move while playing.  I do it instinctively almost reactively to the music.  Trying to suppress it ends up being a concern that wastes attention that could be better spent elsewhere.

---

I'm a huge advocate for not looking at your hands, but obviously the short statement about not doing so lacks a bit of nuance about how to develop solid proprioception enough to get to a point where you don't look.  Dogmatically never looking means you'll make lots of mistakes and repeating those blind guesses builds in a lack of confidence and a lot of sloppy playing.  I think people should intentionally ween themselves off of looking, particularly if they've been playing for a while and are used to it.   For children whose technical facility doesn't even outpace what they are playing it's easy to nip it in the bud, but for more experienced players, it's a major problem.

That said, it could sort itself out if people weren't so damned over-zealous about piece selection.

---

I'm also a huge advocate for HT pretty much always, but once again, there are certainly times where isolated hands separate practice is very useful.  Not necessarily in music.  I'd argue if you can't play a piece of music at least slowly with both hands, it's likely beyond your current level developmentally.

But with technical work there are a ton of times when specifically isolating your hands can yield better results.  I find this to be the case with scale to a large degree.  It's so easy to hide your ragged, slightly uneven left hand under your smooth right hand when playing scales with both hands.  Most people would likely find that if they took their blazing fast HT scales apart and try to play just their left that it was actually a bit of a clusterfuck that would benefit from being slowed way down with a focus on evenness.

Scales are obviously an easy example, but there are tons of other examples to, like I mentioned to someone else in this thread.  Practice of stride with just the left hand and a focus on keeping your eyes up can greatly enhance your stride accuracy and encourage one of your other commandments.  It would actually be a huge waste of time to *always* be playing something else in your right hand if your goal was to focus on accurate, blind leaps in the left hand.

The same can be said for practicing specific rootless voicings, walking bass, common comping patterns, or really almost anything else that tends to dominantly happen in a single hand.

---

1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 I'm absolutely a huge fan of.  I'm such a huge advocate for mindful, focused, goal oriented practice.  I also really try to stop people (particularly those who want to get ""serious"" about piano) from trying to cram as many hours of practice in per day and especially from doing it in single long sessions.  Lots of spaced out sessions work significantly better.

I've also experienced very interesting results with spaced repetition personally.  A huge part of this in terms of how ed psych has looked into it is repeating things as you're about to forget them.  Ultimately that means more frequently early on and less frequently later.

The diminishing returns that come from over-practice are significant and can waste a ton of time.  I think for advanced players finding a way to cycle your work so that you're not hitting the same items every day is a huge benefit.  It also stops you from practicing mindlessly since you tend to actually have to think much more actively about what your'e doing.  For example, if your active reading will increase a lot more if you only hit a piece every other day and you're relying less on short-term memory buffering and just remember certain parts.  

The spaced out practice makes you actively calculate what you're reading anew and really works those mental muscles.  The slowly makes you faster and more efficient at the processing of what you're reading.  On the flip side, if you're hitting the same piece every day... after about a week you essentially have it memorized and it's a technical exercise that you're barely actually paying attention to even if you are keeping your eyes up.  They are just paying lipservice to the page because you know what's coming next.

I also find this effect pretty strong on technical isolation work, but it depends so much on where you are as a player on a given instrument and in overall skill toward that technical hurdle.  I find that on instruments I'm less facile on, more frequent repetition is good, but on piano more space is better.  I mean, I could hit it 3 days in a row, but as a general rule, hitting it only 2 times (on day 1 and 3) yields essentially the same results.  So any time spent practicing it on day 2 is essentially wasted and could be better spent on something else.

Obviously to track your practice and plan out a schedule around this requires an advanced player with good self-assessment and lot of dedication.

Interestingly enough, once I got more advanced as a weightlifter at the gym, I found a pretty similar concept in advanced lifting training called daily undulating periodization.  It's essentially the same concept for the same reasons.  With both lifting and music practice you don't actually get better during lifting/practice... you get better in sleep and recovery.  Min-maxing recovery of different muscle groups and training intensities yields better rewards.  The same is absolutely true with music.",1547539005,As always you said better than I can.

t1_eex3to3,9,t3_ajo2ea,Yeargdribble,piano,"A huge amount of is using music theory and an understanding of form to chunk information together.  It's similar to to how we remember phone numbers (or used to) since you're just remembering 3 chunks rather than 9 numbers.  243-634-2708 is easier than 2436342708

But something a little closer to how it's done in music is the way we think of language.  When you were very young you first had to just figure out how to even make letters.  Eventually you had to figure out what combinations of letters make words.  Eventually that was pretty simple.  Then you get used to reading sentence and understand the basic grammar how things are laid out.

Music is like that.  Chords are a lot like words.  I don't tend to view individual notes.  I see chords as a single unit the way you might see a word as as single idea.

Beyond that, I understand how music is put together in terms of functions of chords strung together.  That's a lot like understanding how sentences are put together.  The sentence, ""The ran dog to stick catch the"" doesn't make any sense, but I bet you could already rearrange those words to fix the syntax and make the sentence make sense because you basically understand the rules of how verbs and nouns function with one another to make sense.

You can even think of that whole sentence as a single thought rather than individual words or letters.  You start to see how it's easy to chunk larger and larger ideas together.  

A lot of music has lots of repeating ideas.  Even if they sound different, they are *mostly* the same.  I could say ""The canine dashed to to grab the branch"" and it's a very similar idea.  You don't have to work that hard to realize it's the same idea with slightly different wording and that happens all the time in music.  This is where form comes in.  Big classical pieces often have form the same way a pop song or church hymn might.  Verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus... or verse-refrain-verse-refrain.  There are tons of different forms, but if you know them and can look at the big picture of how your piece is put together, then you can have a pretty good idea of what you're doing.

It's like a jigsaw puzzle... seeing the picture on the box helps you make sense of it from a big picture perspective whereas just looking at individual pieces wouldn't.

Good ear training also starts to help fill in the picture.  You end up not even thinking about some of the littler bits or if you don't remember them, your ear helps you remember.  You can hear it in your head and you know the general chord structure and your ear gets you the rest of the way there.  It's like if I gave you the sentence ""dog ran catch stick"" ... well, you can fill in all the little words by you basic understanding of what little piece of linguistic glue help connect ideas together.  

Music is just like that.  So like someone memorizing a poem, they have a rough idea of what it's about.  They understand how language works to put it together and just need to remember key words and concepts and fill in the blanks of the rest.",1548417585,"That was very insightful, thanks for posting.

t1_edbt96p,9,t3_acxvnu,IJustCameForTheCake,piano,"Deliberate practice is much more important than just the time you spend in the practice room. If you just want to spend more time, then play fun stuff! Try playing along to your favorite music and just enjoy yourself. But if you really want to make sure your getting the most out of your practice hours, you have to practice deliberately, whether it's 5 minutes or 3 hours - it's about you're level of focus and sustained attention.  

I'd say, rather than focusing on the clock, focus on a goal you'd like to accomplish with that session and dedicate your practice time to that, even if you have to take breaks. Be honest about what passages are tricky and use practice techniques like slowing down with a metronome, or changing the rhythm, blocking notes as chords, etc. That alone can take a lot of time, and if you do it with focus, can make you a much better player. 

If you feel unstructured during practice time, like you'd like to spend more time at the piano but are running out of things to do or bored, then I'd suggest following a routine. Specifically, putting warm ups and exercises before your favorite pieces so you don't run out of the fun stuff too fast!  I saw this article the other day, (posted below - scroll to the bottom of article) it spells out a generic practice routine that's both good for your fingers and fun for your mind! Happy practicing! And remember, deliberately focusing and reaching a goal is more important than time spent sitting in front of the piano.

t1_glf9i59,9,t3_l8y7y0,StinkyTrollfu,piano,"Why not a Fazioli? If you're willing to spend such a big amount of money without even ever playing on a grand piano before, I'd definitely go all out and get the Fazioli F-308. Really expensive, extremely well built, and the wood is absolutely gorgeous. To be honest though, playing wise, you won't notice a difference if I may say.

No offense, but if I had the money, I'd spend it on piano lessons first. Or at least a decent Piano to learn it properly. Most of the pianists here can only dream of owning one. Guess that makes me a bit frustrated... Oh well. I can always save up and one day buy one :)

Um to answer your question: the built quality on a Steinway is superb. On every model. The Yamahas have different levels of built quality. The ones that are made in Japan are usually the better ones. Most Yamahas have a similar touch. Each Steinway is very different from each other... They will all sound good if you know how to play. But if I were to blindly pick to play a Steinway or Yamaha for one concert only, without trying them, I'd choose the Yamaha. 

Long-term purchase, I'd definitely buy a Steinway that I've tried for many many hours! Also, maybe not a brand new Steinway. They take time to develop.",1612050997,"Yeah I never liked Steinways on the show floors, but the 30 year old beaten and scared Steinway at my music academy was gold",1

t1_fshwq22,9,t3_gud87z,SaggiSponge,piano,"You're not voicing the melody well. Practice the melody alone in a musical fashion (dynamics, rubato, pedaling, etc.), but use the same fingerings that you'd use when playing normally. As you do this, really pay attention to the melody. Think about how you want to shape each phrase, and how the end of each phrase leads to the beginning of the next. Practice the melody as though it's a song (you could even sing along as you play). Imagine you're a singer, singing this song in a huge concert hall. You can't timidly approach the stage, barely eking out the melody. You have to have confidence, projecting your voice so that it can be heard even in the far reaches of the hall. The same goes for pianists.

Next, practice the accompaniment alone. Play it **pianississississimo**!! It should be effortlessly quiet. No accents whatsoever. Practice as slow as you need to maintain control over the volume, ensuring that it's as quiet as possible. Eventually, you should be able to speed up to performance tempo, keeping it very quiet and controlled.

Then, play the melody and the accompaniment together. Again, play as slow as necessary to maintain good control over the accompaniment, and strong projection in the melody. Do a few practice sessions where you play the melody very fortissimo, and the accompaniment very pianissimo. Of course, you wouldn't play like this for an audience, but practicing like this will help you get comfortable voicing the melody. Your final goal is to make the melody sound like a beautiful, flowing, effortless song, with a quiet, reserved accompaniment underneath.

For more information on voicing, I'd recommend this series of YouTube videos by Dr. John Mortensen:

[The Sting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScFwCVlKno0)

There's also the issue of pedaling. I hear very little, if any, pedaling. If you're avoiding using the pedal until you learn the notes, I would not recommend that. The pedal is such an integral part of a piece like this, so it should be practiced from the very beginning. Putting it off makes it seem like an afterthought, as though it were just a bit of extra decoration, when in reality it's a key component of this piece. It's literally impossible to get a legato tone out of this piece without using the pedal.

Explaining exactly how to use the pedal is an impossibility. Pedal technique is a rich topic in piano performance, and fully understanding its nuances will take even the best pianists many years.

You could start by finding an edition with pedal markings, and just following that. However, you'll likely find some spots where the written pedaling is either too dry or too blurry. This is where you have to choose pedalings on your own. Your goal is to have a clean, legato melody, with a rich accompaniment. If your accompaniment sounds too dry or your melody sounds too detached, add more pedal. If your melody is getting blurry or your harmonies are overlapping and unclear, use less pedal. The most important thing to do when using the pedal is to **trust your ears!**

For more information on pedaling, I recommend the book [The Pianist's Guide to Pedaling](https://www.amazon.com/Pianists-Guide-Pedaling-MIDLAND-BOOK/dp/0253207320).

P.S. Listen to good pianists playing this piece. [Here's Pollini's recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS7KfOyMEIY), for example. Listen to how beautifully projected his melody is, and how quiet and reserved his accompaniment is. This is what you're aiming for.",1590987576,"I‚Äôve already read through the whole piece and can comfortably play the notes. I appreciate the advice on starting slow tho. I am a relatively impatient player, so going slowly on an already slow song may hurt me, but judging from you advice seems very good for control. I simply practice without pedal because I feel like if I do my best to imitate a performance without it, it is much better when I do start using pedal. I have done a similar thing to practice Berceuse, in which I am fairly confident in my past performances.",1
