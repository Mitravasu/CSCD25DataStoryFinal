t1_es4345l,207,t3_c5puar,KlaatuBrute,photography,"I think the influencer bubble is going to burst soon. I work in marketing at a large online retailer, and we've tried the influencer thing more than a handful of times. They are almost always our worst return on ad spend. We'll get a small uptick in clicks and usually zero actual revenue.

 IMO it's a two-fold issue:

First, the public is getting wise to the influencer thing. It started with noble, worthwhile intentions. ""Hey that blogger—who writes about her experiences as a new mom *strictly* because she loves sharing this information—seems to like New Product X. I trust her opinions on Mommy-ing, so I'll give it a shot."" I get that. Now it's just people selling themselves out for anyone that will give them money. One of the influencers we used posted to her story about a dozen times in a 24 hour period. She was shilling seven different products back to back. Nothing about her posts compelled me to even give these brands a second look. There's no authenticity to it anymore.

Secondly, the influencer world has become its own echo chamber. An influencer with clearly-inflated follower count reached out to us yesterday to see if we wanted to work with her. A quick scroll through her feed showed that her followers were probably fake (25k followers, average of 200 likes per photo). And when she'd get 40 comments on a photo, nearly every single one was from other mommy bloggers. The number might look good, but there was no exposure to potential new customers. 

The bubble is going to burst sooner rather than later, IMO. Brands aren't going to keep spending money without a return. I think a bunch of high-profile ones will survive, and they'll operate similar to any celebrity endorsement. But hopefully the days of girls stomping through fragile ecosystems to take a picture with some collagen water will soon be over.

[The comparison between similar cameras](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/olympus-om-d-e-m5-iii-initial-review/2) is interesting. Only the E-M5 III and G95 have fully articulating screens, and the Olympus probably has better AF? It seems to run you $300 to get IBIS, if you turn down the Fuji X-T30 and Nikon Z50. The Sony slays in battery life, for what it's worth, but is *more expensive* than current sale prices for the flagship X-T3 (which would still lack IBIS, but give you some serious video chops and probably a better user experience). All shoot what would be considered flatly ridiculous burst speeds not too many years ago.

The main message I see from the specs page is that the Olympus probably isn't the best at anything, but it has just about everything you'd want. Need IBIS? Want an articulating screen? Want better than contrast-detect autofocus? That leaves just the E-M5 III.

t1_gtikzvq,81,t3_mkx2md,Crom_3,photography,"Everyone loves to hate on a photographer out shooting in public, even if you aren't shooting photos of people.  Walk around like you own the place.  Wear your gear proudly and don't hide anything you are doing.  I'm a documentary style photographer and love shooting people and what they are doing.  I love meeting new people and hearing their story.  I've found that if you are open and forward about what you are doing it will allay a lot of people's fears.

If anyone looks concerned or starts heckling you, always smile and wave.  I often wear a photo vest when out shooting in public and never want to look dodgy or like I am hiding what I'm doing.  Say hello and strike up conversations with folks you meet, and offer to show them your photos.  Make comments to anyone who looks concerned like ""wow, the light coming through those trees is beautiful!""  Be friendly it's less likely someone will become rude towards you or accuse you of anything.

If you do decide to take photos of people, remember that in the United States taking photos of someone or something clearly visible from a public place is a right protected by the First Amendment.  This applies even if your subject is on private property.  Unless the subject is someplace where they enjoy a ""reasonable expectation of privacy,"" then you can take their photo.

Exactly what a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" means has been argued in U.S. courts, but a person almost always surrenders their expectation of privacy when they venture into a public space.

If someone or something is in plain view of the public then it is almost always legal to photograph it, so long as you aren't doing something extraordinary to overcome the reason efforts of the person to protect their privacy.

For example, if you open the front door of your home and stand in the doorway where you were visible from the street, I can stand in that street and take your photo.  If you open your blinds and stand in the front window of your home and are visible from the street, I can legally take your photo.

But, if you have closed your window blinds or put up a tall privacy fence, then a court may very well rule that you have created a situation that affords you a reasonable expectation of privacy.  And I would be violating that if I shot through a tiny crack in the blinds or climbed your fence to get a photo of you.

All that said, even if you have the legal ""right"" to take a photos, why would you if your subject objects?  When photographing children it's best to get the parents permission first, or if you capture a spontaneous situation first, introduce yourself and show them the images you've made and offer to email them a copy at the very least.

Something else to need to understand is what you can legally use a photo for.  Editorial and educational use is covered by the 1st Amendment of the US Constitution, but not a whole lot else.  You can't generally sell your work for non-editorial or advertising use if you have an identifiable person in it without a signed release.

I worked many years as a newspaper photographer in the Los Angeles area.  I always wore my L.A. Co. Sheriff's Department issued press pass when I was working.  On slow days I might be out hunting for ""wild art"" photos to fill the paper and would sometimes make images of people out and about, sometimes kids in the park.  Afterwards I always introduced myself to the parents, explained who I was and what I was doing and gave them my card.

You probably don't have a press pass, but printing up some cards with your name, ""photographer"" and a phone number and email address might be helpful.  After all, there's not much more satisfying to a photographer than capturing a great image and sharing it with an appreciative subject.  Being open, friendly and willing to share images will sooth a lot of worried parents.  Don't forget your COVID mask.

If folks are shy or downright hostile, it's up to you how you handle it.  Remember, there is always a chance you will have the cops called on you, or, worse, someone get's violent.  IMHO, it's best to assert your rights in an education and friendly way.  Again, why would you want to take someone's photo, especially of their child, without permission?

Inform the concerned subject/parent that it's legal to take photos in public place and you need zero permission from anyone.  But, If you are so inclined, as I would probably be, offer to delete the photos for them so they won't worry.  Be friendly about it.

If someone ever calls the cops on you make sure to stick around until they get there and explain what you are doing.  Most law enforcement officers understand the law and will help calm things down, but there is always a risk that any kind of street photography or photographing of people, especially kids, will be seen as a shady activity.  It's up to you to be reasonable and deescalate the situation the best you can.

And if you are not shooting photos of people, but still get hostile reaction, explain to anyone who seems concerned that you are only shooting photos of the scenery.  Show them your images if you are shooting digital.  Empathize with them that you might be concerned, too, if someone was taking photos near your kid, and do your best to allay any fears they might have.  Pass out a business card if you do photography jobs on the side.  Tell them if they shoot you and email you will reply with a copy of the photo.  Be nice and include permission for them to print or share it for personal use.  But, don't try to sell them the image, that's just rude, IMHO.

Being friendly will earn you and the next photographer out snapping shots a lot of good will.  And it might just save you from a punch in the nose or sitting in the back seat of an overzealous cop's car.

Link isn't specific to k-pop cards, but this should give you a good ball park figure.

If you've got an art shop you can go to near you, they'll usually have a rack of different thickness card, you can go along with your card, and compare thickness by holding it next to it.

You can also ask the guy behind the counter, but you may find it more productive to go into a print shop and ask them instead, and just have a casual conversation about what you've got in mind.

If the trading card is mass produced, the printing technique will be slightly different to when you print off a single photo, it's also important to adjust the picture in Photoshop to get the best colours out, otherwise prints will look too dark!

There is a bit of a trend at the moment, for tiny photo printers, for around £100 quid, that can print similar sized cards, this may be exactly what you need with similar printing paper often available.

Before the 5D mark IV, there was much written about dynamic range.

Now that almost all modern cameras have high enough resolution, solid ISO 3200+ performance, and 12+ stops of dynamic range, the basic needs are met. So the new must-have is eye AF, and given how often we point our cameras at friends, family, pets, and wildlife, I think it's a worthy feature.

I do blur that line a bit with blending photographs from the same location at different times of the day. For example, setting up a shot at blue hour to get good foreground light, and then another exposure for the milky way. Or shooting at sunset for a great sky, and then 30 minutes later during blue hour to get artificial light from a town in the foreground. These feel like part of the same ""moment"" to me, since the photo is about capturing the feeling of the evening, rather than 1/4000 of a second or whatever.

35mm iirc was found to be around 30-40mp in resolution (depending on what film was compared), so that ""fraction of a cost"" doesn't line up long term, and to get all the automated features (ie. good metering, autofocus, weather sealed bodies, etc) you're not much cheaper than a mid level DSLR or mirrorless body.    


You can buy a used A7RII for \~$1100 nowadays with a $20 SD card that will last for tens if not hundreds of thousands of shots (and the body/shutter should go for another 500k on its own) or you can buy a used 35mm camera, lets say an F100 (the cheapest FF 35mm camera with good AF and decent metering in my experience) for like $200-250.  Yes, the Nikon is cheaper...but at \~$5 roll for film (36exp), not counting processing (if you do your own and get a basic darkroom setup you've already surpassed the cost of an RII) your costs will add up ridiculously fast.

t1_eudvmc9,28,t3_cfx8ji,ApatheticAbsurdist,photography,">There is no downside in using the widest colour range when editing (such as ProfotoRGB) and then exporting for what your intended purpose is.

There is always a downside with any profile. They're all compromises and it's always a game of trade off. Here are a couple with ProphotoRGB:

1. It is a wider gamut than any monitor or printer in existence (at least anyone available commercially). You could be editing colors that your monitor cannot represent. In which case you could make an adjustment that makes a color recorded in the file is quite different than the color shown on the monitor, you're making visual adjustments based on the gamut of the monitor and it's limitations and could be recording something very different. If you edit in ProPhotoRGB you should be sure to always double-check with soft proofing and gamut warnings.
2. Larger gamut means that the distance from neutral to the most vivid color is bigger. That also means each step along the way from neutral to that most vivid color is bigger. If you're working in 16 bit that's not a big deal as you'll have 65k steps along the way, but if you drop the file to 8 bit while still in ProPhotoRGB, that means you now only have 255 steps and it could be in some cases that very smooth, soft gradients of color might end up a little more posterized. If you use ProPhotoRGB, you should always work in 16bit (or 32bit) and change to a different profile prior to reducing the bit depth.
3. ProPhotoRGB has a gamma of 1.8. Most profiles people use are gamma 2.2. This doesn't have a huge impact unless you're pulling curves or otherwise ""working by the numbers."" Middle Gray has a value of 128,128,128 (technically 127.5) only if the gamma is an L\* gamma (based off of CIELAB values, eciRGBv2 is such a profile). With a profile that has a 2.2 gamma (like adobeRGB or something close to 2.2 like sRGB) middle gray is going to be around 118,118,118 (or 119... sRGB has a slight tweak to 2.2). With ProPhoto, middle gray is closer around 100. This isn't impossible to overcome but you need to know that your numbers and curves will be different as a results of a different gamma

RAID1 is a mirrored set and copies each block of data to both drives, so if one fails your data is still available on the other one. When you install a new drive to replace the failed drive, it will copy all data from the good drive on to the new drive. This is what you want for archiving data on a pair of drives.

I have too much Nikon glass and Sony's lenses are super expensive, and unfortunately the used marked is still bad, but if I didn't have all those lenses I'd be all over this.

I hope the buttons are better as well, because even the A7III felt like a toy. The image quality and features were never in doubt for me, if they get the body right that'd be exciting.",7

It's fairly RAM hungry but you should *never* have an issue with 32 gigs of memory. 8 gigs of system memory and 45+ megapixel cameras is where things get dicey.

There is no local masking or layers, and it probably never will. It's designed to make that mostly unnecessary, but if you really need to handle massive dynamic range then output two versions from Filmulator and merge them in another application. It's just out of scope for a program I want to stay simple and easy to use.",1611542301,Thank you for the prompt and honest response. I will definitely give this app a try. Looking forward to future updates as well!,7

I had one Meetup where we were set a theme and given an hour to go capture something. By the time the hour was up, this one group of 6-7 guys hadn’t actually left the starting location because they were too busy comparing gear.",1608030140,this is how I imagine things going at those events...,3

A photographer who judges other photographers exclusively by how they look at a screen isn’t a photographer worth giving a hoot about.

At this point, only Sony's first two generations of A7 bodies are cheaper in this format, but they are years old.  I think this is another reason why Panasonic's FF system is going to be dead on arrival.",1550082265,">Wow, how will any other company compete.

Sony will continue to push out FF bodies that are best in class in everything. Fuji will continue to make high-quality small bodies that look great. Nikon will continue making that Noctua lens they've been working on.

>Sounds like this will completely upend the entire market. 

They're definitely aiming for the more economical end of the FF mirrorless market, but that's all. Canon still doesn't have a flagship FF mirrorless yet, so I don't see any upending of the market.",5
