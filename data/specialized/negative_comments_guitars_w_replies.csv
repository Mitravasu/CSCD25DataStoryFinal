If you don't believe that the materials in good guitars - woods, electronics, pickups - are better. Then there's no point in discussing it...

Big difference....",1598737625,I don't believe Gibson makes quality guitars anymore. I also don't believe in supporting greedy corporate assholes who try to sue indie guitar brands despite there being plenty of room in the marketplace for them to not be dickweeds. At any rate i'm not making fun of you for being able to afford things. I'm making fun of the laughable concept that somehow buying a Gibson rather than a less expensive guitar somehow makes someone an 'adult' or lends them some kind of superiority over others. It's absolute bullshit.,1

t1_fiwh9p4,-1,t3_fa4ugm,Halfbl8d,guitars,"> I don’t think Fender is a bad guitar

Fender isn’t a guitar, it’s a company. But assuming you’re referring to strats specifically it still doesn’t make sense for you to claim that they’re “average” considering how many different models of strats there are, all varying widely in quality, specs and price.

My point is that perhaps what you’re perceiving to be average about the guitar may be more a reflection of your ability to play it.",1582785888,"Now, hold up. You don’t know a single thing about this guy’s ability to play. The discussion was about whether fender is the Toyota of guitars. If you disagree with that, then explain yourself. Don’t make a personal attack. That’s called an ad hominem, if you’re not aware, and it’s a type of fallacy—meaning that it has been recognized for centuries as an invalid response to an argument.

With regard to the merits of the argument, fender absolutely is the Toyota of guitars. Fender is reliable without being flashy. It is easy to manufacture, with slab bodies and bolt on necks. But it is rock solid. It has everything you need in a guitar, but nothing more. People love Toyota, and people love fender, myself included. Now is that “marketing,” per se? Some of it is. Fender gives out a lot of guitars to good bands, and launches signature lines, and all of that. Some of it, just like a Toyota, is that the guitar has a proven record of reliability, and historically a pretty attainable cost.",2
t1_gpg0ha0,-1,t3_lw8e5t,newsreadhjw,guitars,"Agreed. As a guitar player I find this not only tacky but very wasteful. Why collect beautiful guitars to put them on display 10 feet up in the air where no one will ever play them?

I always wonder what happens to guitars costing 10,000s of dollars. Do any Frankenstrat copies at that price ***ever*** get played?

Also, even for non-players such guitars are surely too expensive and special to be ""wall guitars"". What do the collectors do with them???",3

But that being said you’re wrong as“swamp ash” is not one kind of tree.  It’s a “genus” comprising of several “species” and doesn’t mean it was growing in a swamp just that they can. 

Maybe get caught up on wiki.

>	Swamp ash is a common name for several North American trees in the genus Fraxinus which may grow in swamps and other wetlands. The wood of swamp ashes is relatively low in density and is used in the construction of musical instruments, particularly electric guitars.[1]",1560634571,"I didn't mean to piss you off, man.
