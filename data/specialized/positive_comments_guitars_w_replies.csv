This is my first regular scaled, non fan fret seven string. It's a lot of fun.

The neck through design makes accessing the whole fretboard very comfortable. The finish is gorgeous. The frets are all very well installed with no dead spots or sharp fret ends.

The pickups are fantastic. Very punchy and boomy.

The one thing I'm not a fan of is the bridge. There's no sides so your hands are resting on the saddles when you palm mute. I might upgrade the bridge to a hipshot if it fits. Still, it's not a huge.

Body dings and scratches have nothing to do with how well a guitar sounds or plays. This is your finger/fret board. That has everything to do with the playability of the guitar. Especially, over time.",1583133931,,

Ernie Ball is decent for me.",1580347112,"Ernie Ball isn't cheap, just inexpensive :) I like them too, but which one do you think works best with this color/wood veneer? I don't have enough guitars for me to have the problem of spending too much on multiple straps lol.

But I also make sure each guitar has a strap solely meant for that guitar. I just don't wanna buy twice, and I'm seeing a lot of new options I haven't seen before now.",2
