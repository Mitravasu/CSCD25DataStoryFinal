> After a prisoner's fear had been allayed, Scharff continued to act as a good friend, including sharing jokes, homemade food items, and occasionally alcoholic beverages. He was fluent in English and knowledgeable about British customs and some American ones, which helped him to gain the trust and friendship of many of his prisoners. In addition, he could empathize with the captured Allied aviators, drawing on the fact that he was not only married to an Englishwoman but also a son-in-law of a World War I British fighter ace (Claude Stokes, as noted above). Some high-profile prisoners were treated to outings to German airfields (one POW was even allowed to take a Bf 109 fighter for a trial run), tea with German fighter aces, swimming pool excursions, and luncheons, among other things. Prisoners were treated well, medically speaking, at the nearby Hohe Mark Hospital, and some POWs were occasionally allowed to visit their comrades at this hospital for company's sake, as well as the better meals provided there. Scharff was best known for taking his prisoners on strolls through the nearby woods, first having them swear an oath of honor that they would not attempt to escape during their walk. He chose not to use these nature walks as a time to directly ask his prisoners obvious military-related questions but instead relied on the POWs desire to speak to anyone outside of isolated captivity about informal, generalized topics. Prisoners often volunteered information the Luftwaffe had instructed Scharff to acquire, frequently without realizing they had done so.",1617357975,"This is sounds like an incredibly disturbing person.

Published October 6, 2016

Thanks to the Former Presidents Act, which became federal law in 1958, U.S. presidents get a few perks once their terms are over: a pension, health insurance, and lifetime protection from the Secret Service. That last one includes a driver, and that means no driving on the open road. Ever.

Since JFK was assassinated, the Secret Service has been very, very strict when it comes to driving privileges-- but there are a few Commanders-in-Chief who just haven't been able to keep their hands off the wheel.

Ronald Reagan drove four-wheel drive Jeeps on his property in Santa Barbara, and George W. Bush drove a truck on his ranch in Texas. Barack Obama has driven a Chevy Volt twice-- once on the White House grounds and once after touring an assembly line. Oh, and he caused a commotion in 2014 when he was spotted driving a golf cart solo (Secret Service was not happy)",1603631447,"JFK was assassinated while being a passenger.

Maybe it was because I wasn’t getting parts in those movies, but I was like, “Oh, wow. You’re going off and getting all of that. What about people who actually go to war?” The actors were like owning this experience as if it was like this real and incredible experience.

t1_g5pcj1u,6925,t3_iv6w8j,WhileFalseRepeat,todayilearned,"Those three Presidents whose deaths were most consistent with that of enteric fever and/or a gastrointestinal infection (and which could have been brought on by a parasite or bacteria introduced through contaminated water in the White House) were William Henry Harrison, James K. Polk, and Zachary Taylor.

Another possible death due to White House water supply includes Abraham Lincoln's son, Willie Lincoln.

Interestingly, William Henry Harrison, who many have attributed his death to pneumonia after having given a two hour speech made in cold and rainy conditions, likely died of septic shock due to enteric fever (typhoid or paratyphoid). Harrison was the oldest President to serve other than Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump and he may have been particularly susceptible to illness. He also was the first President to die in the White House and has the distinction of being the shortest-serving president in US History after having only served 31 days prior to death.

Zachary Taylor, who many have attributed to having died from eating too much iced milk and cherries, also ""partook freely of water"" during that fateful binge eating day. His symptoms prior to death, including violent diarrhea and vomiting, are most closely associated with water-borne illnesses. It is also known that several of his cabinet members had come down with a similar illness during his Presidency.

Polk, the other former President included in this list, spent much of his life fighting various illnesses and suffered from gastroenteritis as President - but the bout of cholera which would kill him included gastrointestinal issues which also haunted Harrison in his final days. ~~Polk died only three months from having served as President and prior to Harrison taking office.~~ Polk died about three months from having served as President and his term preceded Zachary Taylor taking office (who would also die shortly thereafter).

As for Willie, Abraham Lincoln's son, he frequently bathed in an upstairs bath that was being fed by water which Union soldiers were relieving themselves and dumping discarded animal carcasses (the Potomac River).

All of these deaths, which shared many of the same symptoms, occurred within a timeframe of 20 years. And the commonality between all was a White House which had a water supply filled with feces, urine, and dead animals.

Here’s info on the hypothesis, since you kind of have to search to find it in the wiki:


McKenna's hypothesis was that low doses of psilocybin improve visual acuity, particularly edge detection, meaning that the presence of psilocybin in the diet of early pack hunting primates caused the individuals who were consuming psilocybin mushrooms to be better hunters than those who were not, resulting in an increased food supply and in turn a higher rate of reproductive success.[3][7][16][26][43] Then at slightly higher doses, he contended, the mushroom acts to sexually arouse, leading to a higher level of attention, more energy in the organism, and potential erection in the males,[3][7] rendering it even more evolutionarily beneficial, as it would result in more offspring.[26][43][74] At even higher doses, McKenna proposed that the mushroom would have acted to ""dissolve boundaries,"" promoting community bonding and group sexual activities.[12][43] Consequently, there would be a mixing of genes, greater genetic diversity, and a communal sense of responsibility for the group offspring.[79] At these higher doses, McKenna also argued that psilocybin would be triggering activity in the ""language-forming region of the brain"", manifesting as music and visions,[3] thus catalyzing the emergence of language in early hominids by expanding ""their arboreally evolved repertoire of troop signals.""[7][26] He also pointed out that psilocybin would dissolve the ego and ""religious concerns would be at the forefront of the tribe's consciousness, simply because of the power and strangeness of the experience itself.""[43][79]

They did it a handful of times before they were caught

Edit: I'm only recalling it from memory, so those of you who are skeptical or are correcting me, sorry. It was on a TIL post a while back, and I'm sure it gets reposted every so often.

They got ""caught"" by being found out and the rules changed again. They weren't legally liable, someone from the department who handles lotteries found out or something and they just changed the rules, but the group got to keep their money.

Either way it's good for the state. They get the revenue anyways, it more so keeps whales from buying out the lottery from under the less fortunate and winning constantly and sort if protects the little guy.

The McDonald Coffee lawsuit was the result of an older woman  purchasing a cup of coffee from McDonalds. At the time McDonalds heated and served their coffee at nearly* boiling, and hot enough to cause 3rd degree burns.

Essentially this woman purchased a cup of coffee and spilled it on her crotch while in the car; the coffee was so hot it caused 3rd degree burns all over her legs and caused parts of her labia to fuse together.

She sued McDonalds under the argument they created an unnecessary hazard to their costumers by heating and serving the coffee so close to boiling that it could cause serious burns. If I understand, her personal reason for doing so was to seek damages to pay for her medical costs as a result of the incident.",1602945454,[deleted],328
