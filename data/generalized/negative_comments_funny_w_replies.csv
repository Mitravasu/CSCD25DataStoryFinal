Get a scale. Measure the Pyrex with the fading measurements. Write that weight on the Pyrex. Now you always know how much it weighs.

Most liquids weigh 8lbs per gallon (something as viscous as, say, molasses, will probably weigh a bit more). Now just a little math, and you can still use it to do volume measures of liquid.

For example, say my Pyrex weighs 1lb. I adjust the scale 1lb. I need 2 cups of heavy cream. If a gallon of heavy cream (16 cups) weighs 8lbs, then 2 cups of heavy cream weighs 1lb. Bingo.",1593908112

t1_fxxsyrf,-2,t3_hqd6uz,MartelFirst,funny,"Ask the people working in Disney if they want a job or not, instead of deciding for them. 

The latest news I've read is that Covid-19 has a 0.5% mortality rate, including the elderly who are most affected, which is admittedly HUGE for any pandemic. But most workers in Disney are rather healthy young people, and are likely to survive infection, and most won't even realize they got it. So no, it's not 5% mortality like you're suggesting with your 1 in 20 dice roll analogy.

Other latest news say that this virus is so contagious that pretty much everyone living in an urban area will be infected.

I'd suggest elderly people, and people with weaker immune systems, should isolate. Perhaps they should get a doctor's note to justify state financial help in order to self isolate. Otherwise, other people should be allowed to work and live again. 

I work in a museum in a big European city and I'm happy to be working again and to get a full salary. But for the last 4 months when I was off work I was still paid 80% of my salary thanks to the state. I can't imagine how it is in the US where there are fewer benefits like this.

As i said, politics abuse of this. The city aint a large scale scientific studies, its politics. And your doctor aint a large scale scientific studies, its a single isolated doctor. Everyone have ideology and opinions, including doctors. That's why we run large-scale scientific studies to check things, instead of relying on a single doctor saying something.

Yes you are certain but still have 0 knowledge of it and never checked it properly. That's the problem here. Lot of certitude, 0 knowledge. And that push you into hating people for not being into your own dogmatism, that's the most fun part i'd say. Just like religious people feeling hate for non-religious people (and killing them for that very reason at some point in history). Same mechanics. Again, grab some humility, learn about scientific methodology. And overall, about human bias.

It's not trickle-down, it's scaling, logistics, and totally different tax systems for different sources of income and types of organizations. You dipshitocrats don't even know the basics, just ""the rich"" VS ""the poor"", and democrat hyperbole about rich republicans trying to steal your money. Maybe if you started learning up on money and finance, you'd realize it's the democrats stealing your money and the republicans trying to protect your right to succeed at life. 

The democrat way actually benefits the monster corps, believe it or not. Poor people are poor for a reason, and that reason is because they have no concept of budgeting, business, or economics. They have money, they spend it, simple as that. And where does it go when spent? Straight into Amazon, Walmart, Apple, etc. So, ""the rich"", that is, corporations like Amazon and Google are all for the leftist agenda... why do you think they constantly promote it, while shunning anything right-leaning from social media? They want all the tax money going to poor people, because they will spend it straight into big corp's pockets. 

And how here is why rich people are rich: They do know money and finance, and they know it well enough to stay rich regardless of politics. Go the republican way, and all that money stays with people who invest it in stocks, still benefiting the big corps. So they're all for the republican agenda as well... any way you slice it, they're masters of money and won't be giving it all to you any time soon. And that's good... if you dissolved Amazon and gave their entire net worth to the poor, each person would only get a couple grand at best, it would be spent within a week, and they're still poor and now don't have Amazon to buy stuff from, or get a job at.

Also I grew up in several houses that all had recessed roll holders. If  you mount under in those you often get an end of toilet roll you can't reach because it's  between the roll and the cavity. Thinking about it those recessed holders had grooves cut into the ceramic to guide the holder down into place. If you were feeding sheets out from an under mounting you are likely to cause the holder to ride up the grooves and then pop out of the recess. Those recessed holders were designed to be over mounting only.",1610278957

I was correcting the blanket statement that ""Males are scientifically gonna be more aggressive than females"" as it is important to distinguish interdog aggression vs. dog-human aggression, and at least in the first 2 sources, there is a significant association with female gender and interdog aggression. 

My perspective comes from seeing lots and lots and lots of dog-fight trauma from interdog aggression. I'm not in the human medical field so I don't see human trauma as a result of dog bites. In my opinion, the incidence of interdog aggression is way beyond the incidence of dog-human aggression (dog fight trauma is one of the most common reasons dogs come into veterinary emergency rooms), so it stands out to me as being an equally important parameter of dog aggression. I don't have time to add sources for incidence of human-directed aggression vs. interdog aggression, but dogs attack / kill each other just like humans attack / kill each other.",1583421700

Police shoot first and ask later, literally by training. Dave Grossman literally teaches that the best sex a cop can have will come after he kills another human being. He goes on to say that police NEED to kill first because EVERYONE wants to kill them. 

So no, fuck cops as long as they proscribe to the notion that they are superior to others, as long as they are shielded by idiots like you from wrong doing, as long as they literally teach each other that one of the ""perks"" of the job is the ability to kill someone and then go home and have ""mindblowing sex"" knowing you murdered someone.

It seems very tame and lame to write a whole essay on one thing you said. But I'm not here to hate you or attack you.

Then there was evidence she had been hired to be there, and while she certainly could have said “no” to Kobe (which would have absolutely been rape if she did), when they took samples of semen, she had several (five?) other men’s semen on her body from that same night, none of whom she implicated, identified, or even spoke about during her statement to police.

Kobe being the only celebrity of the group, this meant to the courts, that while his semen was certainly present, he was likely identified as the offender solely due to his financial status - implying she simply wanted a bigger payout. IIRC, once this evidence was admitted into court (after a failed motion by the prosecution to suppress it I believe), she withdrew her charges with no settlement, even though she had been offered a settlement prior to the case being brought forward.

In the end, Kobe was likely nothing more than a dirty cheater, and his wife ended up with a new, multi-million dollar ring, and he went back to California, to repair his image and be a better person. Which, by all accounts, he got right on his second chance.",1580205428

* I don't want to run across the house to answer the door anyway

For Them:

* They can deliver the package roughly 10-20x faster if they don't have to wait for me to come to the door, possibly give them a hard time or make small talk, ask them questions, etc.
* Most of the time people will not be home or not answer like me.  They shouldn't have to wait 60 seconds at every single house when most of the time it will be futile

You guys can disagree with my reasoning/desires, but it doesn't change reality.  In the United States they are NOT liable if the package is stolen, unless you specifically paid for shipping insurance.

Edit: thanks for the gold kinda stranger I didn’t expect this post to blow up! My life started growing up in a small farm in northern Kansas. My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn’t have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn’t beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up. One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn’t know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out. We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun’ a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn’t doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior. I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I’ve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me gold. Thank you again kind stranger.",1599440222

Perhaps next time you should leave a quarter under your child’s pillow and put as much effort into promoting proper hygiene as you do to making other people laugh.

Those laws are made with cars with safety systems in mind, cars that just burn a little gas to start moving, cyclists don't get either of those.

I think it's kind of dumb to say cyclists should be treated like cars, that would be just plain dangerous in actual practice.

There is absolutely no way that the concentration of ambient helium was high enough to cause a change in the drivers voice just from a couple balloons popping...

And if it *was* that high, then it could’ve only been caused by literally ***pumping*** straight helium gas into the inside of the car AND also would’ve been high enough that both of you most likely would’ve passed out.

Seriously - why lie about dumb shit like this? Go take a helium balloon and pop it near your face and breathe in.. do it with 10 or 15 balloons even. Guarantee you it won’t change your voice at all, because the second it’s popped and mixes with the atmosphere, it becomes way too diluted by oxygen/nitrogen to actually have any effect.. Inside of a car is no different and you could literally pop EVERY balloon inside a car and it most likely still would not be enough to cause any effects, because it’s still mixing with the regular air AND there’s normal air constantly entering circulation into a car interior — they are not vacuum sealed.",1613198610

... which are more often than not passed down from the parents or started in early childhood before the person has a chance to be in control of their own actions. Research shows that diet can actually affect one's microbiome, which in turn leads to cravings for carbs and sugars and a lessened ability to digest nutrients, becoming a vicious cycle that is very hard to break. There's also evidence that shows that adenovirus-36 can cause obesity in someone who was previously thin. *And* there's evidence that even once a person loses their extra weight, they need to eat a significantly smaller amount forever, or the weight piles right back on. A formerly overweight person has to exercise more and eat less than someone who was never overweight. But sure, let's just assume they're lazy. 

There's also plenty of evidence that shows that exercise, dietary changes, and being outdoors in green spaces significantly reduce depression symptoms, but it's not okay to tell people they're depressed because they just haven't made the right lifestyle changes.

Then it's just a manner of being safe with contact on Halloween, but a lot of folks found good solutions for that, whether it was candy chutes, mechanical arms, or gift bags on the front stoop.

Not necessarily. In some ways, in your view, sure. But in other cases it is providing the community with food, helping build housing, giving to local charitable organization, and more. I have never seen a church that didn't do this.

>Good things done in a religious community do not validate religion, that's a fallacious argument.

That's not how this works. You'd need to prove how religion is invalidated by the negative actions. Asking someone to prove how something isn't invalidating is asking that person to prove a negative, which is a fallacious request.

>People do good things regardless of their faith and some of those people just happen to be religious.

Except in many cases people do more good things as called by their faith than they did in its absence.

Nah, it's difficult to know what you should do if plugged in all the time.

If you leave a lithium ion battery >70-80%, it ages quickly.  So do you charge to 100% when plugged in, or not?  Do you stop charging and then let it deplete to 70% off the battery then draw USB power again?  Etc.

This is why cellphones have ""optimum battery charging"" features to go to 80% and then finish the charge up just before you normally unplug... but this is a lot harder to do for a mouse.

I've designed and programmed the firmware for battery management systems and charge controllers.  I disagree that this is anywhere near a ""solved problem.""",1605813988

The easy money in combination with increased demand (millennials being convinced they MUST get some kind of 4-year degree from a famous institution to be successful/happy, which is just not true), turns college education into a seller's market.

After all if you're a university, and there's all this free federal money floating around, and you can stick the bill on your customer, why wouldn't you take it?

It’s really a pot calling the kettle black type thing, super head scratching moment. I honestly am not super certain why people have a hard time understanding why a parent might not care if their kids use swear words.

Obviously the exception is that with enough effort you can bring most of the other parts back to life by replacing one.

&#x200B;

I hate to put it to you this way, but in the electronics nerd world, it's fairly common knowledge that the plans apple made were from previous mistakes of upgrading, and deciding what to bring and what not to bring. Newer models are designed to handle x cycles, x battery cycles, x nand cycles, etc., though you probably won't be running through your flash any time soon. As apps or software upgrades, they demand more of your phone than a regular model would. So you're left with a few choices. Be left in the dust, have a higher rate of failure, or gimp the device. If you are given the option to opt out, and your voltage fucks you, you're going to blame apple regardless. It would be a stupid decision not to profit while fixing a problem by making yourself look better than the previous choices.

&#x200B;

Like you're legitimately arguing that the phones should be left at max boost for routine usage and people wouldn't be even more pissed when they got more errors and broken phones instead of a safer ceiling. Do you want your phone to be slower, or do you want to lose all your data unless you back it up safely because your phone may error or shut down at ANY time, just simply because an app called for processing in the background of what you were currently doing.

# FAQ

## What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

## Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* you used an emoji / several emojis
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.

## Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",1592309949

Edit

Well I see the idiot protesters are still here, figures. Like I said, hopefully things are getting back to normal. These BLM protestors think police officers are out targeting black people, killing one every day when that's not even close to the facts. Now they are seeing how stupid these protest are, blocking traffic and when one person, minding their own business, honks their horn to get through, they are labeled a Nazi. According to these protesters and the people who down voted and reacted to this comment, if you ain't with them you are a racist Nazi. Fingers still crossed here, hopefully we get back to normal soon. Grow up people, things aren't as bad as you are making it out to be. Take this hate you have and put it to postive use. Instead of marching down the streets blocking traffic, why not go into these low income inner city suburbs and clean them up. Build a play ground, start a community farm on a vacant lot, buy food for the hungry, something besides looting and destroying towns. Again, you guys need to grow up, things aren't as bad as you think it is. Haven't been in a long time.

Believe it or not, it does more harm than good when families, especially with young kids, adopt a puppy or young dog that was born in a shelter. The great thing about *GOOD* breeders is that they spend time with their puppies and really get a sense of what each one is like. Shelters 9 times out of 10 don't do that, plus they spay and neuter at 2mo minimum which is way too young. That and the history of the puppies isn't known as well. I'm not saying it is wrong to adopt shelter dogs, but it isn't always the right thing to do for most people. There isn't anything wrong with going to a breeder either as long as you've done your research and spoken to them and learn what good thing to look for, plus what NOT to look for. Statistically, if every person in the world who wanted a dog went to a respectable and proper breeder, shelter overcrowding would not be as much of an issue as it is.

Your grade school math simply takes the deaths and divides by the population, and yes, when you do that, it appears to indicate that blacks are more likely to be killed by the police. But grown ups like Professor Roland  Fryer (youngest ever tenured professor at Harvard, and happens to be black) did a detailed analysis of the numbers , in which he factors in behaviors ( I.e commit half the murders and a similar percentage of all violent felonies) and not unexpectedly, you see that there is no bias towards the use of deadly force against blacks. In fact, according to Professor Fryer and a number of other scholars who’s study of the topic goes much deeper than Reddit cartoons, blacks are actually less likely to be killed by the police, by a substantial margin. Here is a direct quote from his analysis(page 23 for the TL;DR generation)

“Given the stream of video “evidence”, which many take to be indicative of structural racism in police departments across America, the ensuing and understandable outrage in black communities across America, and the results from our previous analysis of non-lethal uses of force, the results displayed in Table 5 are startling.
Blacks are 23.8 percent less likely to be shot by police, relative to whites. Hispanics are 8.5 percent less likely to be shot but the coefficient is statistically insignificant.
Rows (2) through (6) add various controls, identical to those in table 1D. “

Here is a link to his study, if you ever find yourself wanting to know what is actually happening in the world, instead of just guzzling the Kool-Aide.

I hate to say it, I’d be scared too, because I wouldn’t know what’s going on. I’d be chill about the protestors, but why are they right here, right now? Are they being chased?

The hormones create lust, lust creates tension, when you relieve tension you get pleasure. This is pretty much the same system in all mammals.

You don't really know how animals feel exactly about it do you since they can't speak,  but I does seem quite obvious when animals get neutered they aren't very happy about it, and they seem very happy when they get offspring.

Still,  I'm not going to chastise people who neuter their pets, not everyone can cater a natural habitat for their pets so they aren't bothered with there unneutered behaviour.

So you might want to calm down before you get another hissy fit.

But saying neutering is better for the animals isn't really true, it's mostly an advantage for the owner.",1621494693

Also, most ""poor people"" work very hard to make smart choices, honor their agreements, and stay out of default.

In light of last night's discovery that intelligent extraterrestrial life is on its way to Earth, we have been asked to temporarily suspend any April Fools' Day pranks or celebrations. Once the aliens' intentions have been established (and once we have explained the concept of a joke to them), a do-over date will be set, and the merriment will continue as planned.

Stay safe... and keep an eye on the stars.

The thing about Apple is that until recently, the have never been innovative. All they did, was implementing existing solutions and implementing them well. You could say they're like Edison or Musk. Not about inventing something new, but about making a new solution viable both economically and via marketing. They take what's possible and make it 'cool'.

The thing about Samsung is that their product seems to only follow the trend, implement things that were already implemented and made mainstream. They don't make things cool, they just take what's cool and try to use it. Just like parents fail at youth jargon. And it's equally cringe.

""Higher rates of concealed carry permit holders are even more strongly associated with reduction in violent crime than are “right-to-carry” states. The probable reason for this is that “right-to-carry” studies often include “open carry” states, which have not been shown to correlate with more people actually carrying or even owning firearms. Rates of concealed carry permit holders are better indicators of the number of people who actually possess and carry firearms within a given population.""

""Do compound lifts and count calories"" is pretty much Reddit's go-to fitness advice. And sure, it works wonders if you're able to actually stick to it.

But like I said, he's probably heard the advice before. Hell, I know it's the best thing and I'm still always trying new plans because I personally *suck* at tracking stuff like that. Some work, some don't.

I think what some people here get frustrated with is some people's compulsion to *always* give advice. And sure, sometimes that compulsion comes from a good-hearted place, wanting to help others. But it just as often comes from an ""I know something and I want other people to know I know this thing"" type of attitude.

And hell, especially after this past year, some people just want to rejoice in the small victories. And sometimes unsolicited advice on top of your victories feels more like someone saying ""You suck, do better"" than it does someone saying ""good for you, and here's something to help you out!""",1617085418

Think back on the teachers in school that taught you. You mightve had better teachers than others to get you better grades or a better understanding of the work you do.

Think back on what your parents told you when you got your first savings account. Some people are never taught how to save. 

Think back on your good health. Some people have cancer and treatments with no insurance can costs thousands annually.

Think about the area you live or moved to. In my county, a house is 650k. Look on Zillow. There's nothing available below 650k. Studio condos are starting at 300k. Apartment life is the only life I've known, and I'm one of the lucky ones that can afford to save for a house on top of paying 2k monthly to a landlord.

My point is, just because you are doing well off at a young age, it doesn't mean it's because of hard work and your sole perseverance.

2. I don’t actively say it to my friends when they go there unless they ask why I don’t. I will say something on reddit, cause why not.
3. I have LGBTQ+ family, and i realized at a young age what they had to go through to have their own family and it’s frustrating that people who deserve more than me have to face these organizations that are actively against them.

These include 225 credit hours worth of classes about 3,875 actual in class/lab hours. You must pass 4 parts of national board certification along with 1 part for physical therapy. Most schools have 2-3 of their own mock boards you must pass as well. Some states also require a board certification individually. I'm not sure if it's a national requirement or a school requirement but there are 1500 in clinic hours required as well before you may obtain your doctorate. 

Chiropractors in the US are portal of entry providers in every state which means that you do not have to have a referral from a Primary care physician.  This is why chiropractors must undergo extensive training in multiple areas because they must have the understanding of basic diagnosis in order to refer patients to the appropriate physician. In some states chiropractors are considered primary care physicians which means They provide continued care for various medical conditions not limited by cause or diagnosis.

If a bug came along that adapted to destroy bamboo forests, they would be extinct then.

Humans are certainly the most effective single species for causing other species' extinction, but we're far from the only source.

Pandas adapted to fill a niche. That's good, generally. Being too much of a generalist and you're competing with many more things. Being so specialist in your niche that a single factor could wipe you out? Not so good.

I'm not advocating we shouldn't be trying to keep the cute little buggers alive, but they aren't polar bears, or wolves, or other creatures like that. Polar bears are well equipped to survive, but we've wiped out their habitat so fast, they're struggling. We spent a few centuries nearly hunting timber wolves to extinction, but they're bouncing back.

We could have taken centuries, maybe even over a thousand years, to wipe out pandas' habitats, and they still probably wouldn't be able to adapt. Poor little guys aren't *entirely* our fault.",1598054414

The main reasons why the US is showing pre tax prices is that you corporations earn more money.

Imagine you want to sell a premium toaster and the sales tax is 5%

You put the toaster on sale for $99.99 because you learned that people are tricked by this price and consider is as a two digit cost item. With sales tax the customers are paying around $104.98. 

If you had to include the sales tax you would not sell your toaster for the unattractive price of $104.98. Instead you would reduce the price to $99.99 to improve your marketing. After taxes this would be $95.22. 

The customer would save 4.8%.

Of course you could now argue. What do these few bucks matter? Well, if quickly sums up to a large sum. If you are spending $2000 a month to buy all kinds of goods like food, utilities and so on you would 4.8% would be more than $1150 which would amount to 2 PS5s after taxes.",1619823247

The most extreme outgrowth of this type of personality are groups like the Proud Boys, but a huge segment of society has these traits.

What’s disgraceful is having to choose between Trump and the useless monkey who’s been in office for 50 years (rounding up), who has a son facing criminal charges for his money laundering Ukrainian scheme...I could go on. The Democrats and BLM are an absolute disgrace to the USA. 

All the anti-American propaganda and disgusting libel being spread by the left, who happily censor the right, is absolutely disgraceful.

But Trump serving fast food to people who are thankful for standing by a company that supports their values? That’s not disgraceful. That was connecting to his audience, who understands the left unfairly misrepresents the right at every given turn.

It’s not a crime to be conservative, or to have family values, or to stand for Christian principles  - principles on which this country’s laws have their origin. But the left wants to eradicate that.

My cousin was born very premature because his mum smoked. As a result his growth hormone is fucked up and he can't produce enough to look normal. He is 26 but looks like a 13 year old child. When he was 13 he looked like a 7 year old. 

He can't get a girlfriend because women aren't attracted to men who look like children. He can't even fucking get into bars sometimes because bouncers think his ID is fake. Hot girls call him ""little steve"" and treat him like a cute child. He doesn't get the respect he deserves as a man with a job and a university degree.

Maybe if people had hassled his mum when she smoked he'd be leading a normal lfe right now.

Flu vaccine is a big one ( don’t take it)

Economically speaking and mathematically speaking, that's exactly what it is. Sorry bud.  The good news is, if you truly in your heart believe that cashiers deserve $15.00/hr, you're completely free to shop exclusively at whole foods. That's your choice!

Even better news, minimum wage isn't some quicksand where you get stuck in.  There are millions of better jobs out there. 

Statistically speaking if you wait to have kids until you're married, graduate high school and work full time you're basically guaranteed not to live in poverty in some minimum wage shithole in the U.S.A

So no, I don't feel like every grocery store should charge whole foods prices and pay whole foods wages. I'm perfectly content knowing the highschool kid bagging my groceries is making a couple hundred dollars a week. 

I lived independently when I worked at a grocery store. I also only worked for minimum wage for a total of three months. Honestly, if you make minimum wage for more than a year you're probably a loser. That's okay though. Plenty of losers get their shit together.

What do we get from treating sex as binary when it isn't other than reinforcing incorrect beliefs about sex and gender that are used to fuel misunderstanding and hatred of people. 

People try to claim gender is binary and usually base it on sex being binary. Reinforcing the underlying incorrect understanding of sex reinforces the belief that gender is also binary rather than disputing it. 

If a digital data stream is made up of non binary data and I say it's made up of binary data I would be wrong. Sure we are imprecise often in our colloquial speech and it's often not really important but if we were talking about a data stream and someone was basing an incorrect notion on the imprecise understanding of the stream being binary at that point it is better to correct them and be precise than to hand wave the imprecision away and reinforce the wrong notion.

Acting generally like sex is binary isn't a huge deal and likely won't impact much. When discussing sex and gender however it becomes more important to be accurate so as not to reinforce incorrect notions of things being binary that are not. 

People accepting that sex is not a true binary helps them accept that gender is also not a binary. This in turn increases acceptance of people who don't fit into that binary in the more common ways and makes their lives better and happier.",1590169415

The Cornetto Trilogy is all I can think of, and there's nothing edgy in any of them. I honestly cannot think of one movie as funny as BS other than Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz (third one was kinda eh).

Edit - it seems I'm getting a lot of hate for this comment. I don't understand why though. The flight is much more comfortable when I recline, which is why everyone does so. I expect the person in front of me to recline also - it's how the seats are made to be used.

If you are too big to properly sit in a normal seat, that's kinda on you to pick a seat you can fit in. Economy plus, front rows, and exit rows all have more leg room. It's not my fault you picked a seat that you cannot properly fit in, and it's not fair to tell me i have to be uncomfortable because of your choices.

I'm going to continue to recline my seat when I fly, which is the normal operation of the seats for us all to enjoy. If you can't fit in a normal seat, don't buy a normal seat and then turn around and try to make other people uncomfortable for the sake of your own comfort.",1570824108

No, most gyms you just show up, maybe some college student shows you a few machines and your are left to figure it out.

Every crossfit gym is going to be different quality, but nearly every one is going to require a few weeks of dedicated beginner classes before you can join the regular classes. And it'll likely be taught by someone with at least the most basic certification. And you'll receive continuing instruction (and feedback) from trainers every day in the regular class, along with supervision during the workouts.

Is it a perfect solution? Of course not. Perfect would be one on one all the time with physical therapist, but that is prohibitively expensive.

But it's still pretty good. I learned more about training my first year of Crossfit, and better results, than I did in 4 years of the Marines. And part of that is that they don't focus just on exercise, they also focus on diet and recovery and other healthy lifestyle factors.",1550716822

It's a classification that we came up with. Most of the men within the gay community are widely known for having sex in the assholes of other men. Duh. Ever heard of AIDS? and the epidemic that happened because of these men fucking bum bums?

So trying to defend the fact by giving an example of the minority group that doesn't fuck buttholes is a misrepresentation of the group as a hole ;) and you should know this because you seem to have a comprehensive understanding of the classification of this particular sexual orientation.

Also if you want to ONLY fuck your wife's asshole.. You have something going on.. So yeah.. it does define you a little bit. Butt like I said, it's just a made up class of people anyway.. we're just animals wanting to fuck whatever we can.

Doesn't matter as much if the cops arrest white people when the judge lets them off. First offender or third, for the same crime, non-whites tend to get harsher sentences. When the facts and numbers are on your side, you can be a little bit smug.

Doesn't matter what your friend/cousin/brother/dad went to jail for, it's *statistically likely* that if he was white, he was shown lenience. Maybe he was, maybe he wasn't, but he *WAS* statistically likely to have.

Its actually pretty clever. And in no way a new revalation. Well, surely not to most of us at least... 🤣

Granted it is also problematic to have the disparity because it causes inflation in the rural areas when the people eventually retire, no longer want to pay the taxes and move to places with lower tax rates and lower costs of living with the money they earned working in said higher cost regions.",1571168395

3. However, this orchestra is actually a middling-at-best middle school band, so any perceived coordination is mostly accidental.

Same sentiment without needlessly gesturing at social status by race, which is irrelevant to your primary point. Same as if you had pointed out that it was a wind ensemble band; in writing, these are superfluous details. But when racially tinged, they become _insensitive superfluous details_ — or — _superfluous details with an agenda_. To be clear, I am not accusing you of the latter, as per my OP comment ""I know you meant no foul.""",1552598376

CBS News:


>Vaccines have saved untold millions of lives, and the vast majority of people who get them suffer no major problems.

>But there's a trade-off: occasionally, vaccines cause injury or death. Very rarely, patients are left with what's known as ""encephalopathy"", the medical term for brain damage.

>**In fact, CBS News has found nearly 1,300 cases in which vaccine-related brain damage has been compensated in court over the past 20 years**.


https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vaccines-autism-and-brain-damage-whats-in-a-name/



Those nearly 1,300 are only the ones that got **payouts**; there are many, many more who didnt even know that this was possible,  or didnt have the financial resources to prove to the court that their vaccine damage was caused by vaccine. 



Edit: it is astonishing to see how many people make decisions based on emotions  stoked by industry propaganda.  This is solid information from s good source, and people still intentionally avoid looking at it, in favor if their preconceived ideas.  Brain damage, indeed.",1551578218

He pushed socialism, and social democratic parties. It was the Russian Revolution and Lenin who created Communism. And every instance of such has been imposed upon the people with an iron will.

The intent doesn't excuse the realities of Communism. It is a classic example of utopias really being dystopias in disguise. In fact if you look at Marx's writings and the ideals of Socialism and Communism, and you apply sociology and Game Theory, you'd realize that something like that could never exist without authoritarian or totalitarian governments, and due to the nature of people, and the lessons of Game Theory, these will almost always result in oppression and destruction of the very people that Marx's ideals and Communism were supposed to benefit and protect.

This fact is evident across the world and across history of countries, and people's, and governments who have attempted to implement such ideals. They've always resulted in failure, becuase there are no protections against the corruption of man.

And further, even the ideals of Capitalism and the Free Market have never been implemented in their proper entirety. There is tons of evidence of the failings of those socioeconomic systems as well. There is no such thing as a utopia, just the lesser of all the evils.

Before plumbing, wizards used magic to get rid of bowel movements to inhibit disease. 

One person tweeted to her that she imagined Heromine as black, and she tweeted back saying that's an awesome interpretation (which is fine considering race is never a big deal).

Given the video, divide that aforementioned height into 5-6 equally tall ""stairs"".  Then place those stairs in a somewhat snaking arrangement with railings requiring the climber to move up a stair, then turn almost 180 degrees before climbing the next stair.  Then make the entrance to this stair structure further away in distance than that of just travelling up the comparing ramp.  Because it is a race, you would assume the subject would be attempting to traverse this structure as quickly as possible.  You could probably time this, lets say it is something like 3 times as long of a process.  So - more climbing, more maneuvering, more distance, longer time, similar speeds.  This isn't comparing any ramp versus any stairs.

So context matters.  Unless you are arguing a 4 foot ramp rising 1 inch is harder than climbing to the top of one of the Pyramids of Giza... but who would make a stupid assumption like that?

Peta offers advocacy for people who feel their pets suffered injury or malpractice at vet and grooming businesses.    


if a business chooses to settle,  it's not extortion.    extortion is,  pay us or else.    if someone brings a lawsuit against you,  you hire a lawyer and go to court.   There is no possible way Peta could string out some litigation style court case.    Someone alleges a wrong doing,  you dispute it, you go to court.   A vet probably should have insurance against such suits.     


further more,  Peta is not likely to be suing any business.  Or making money by doing so.   Peta would have no legal claim of damages,  it would have to be an individual who owned a pet,  had some service provided by a business and had some claim of wrong doing.  


if Peta was suing so many vet clinics such that 30 in some small area were affected there'd be press on it.

L'idée socialiste, sous de multiples formes, se développe au long du XIXe siècle et donne naissance dans le monde entier à des partis politiques s'en réclamant sous diverses dénominations (socialiste, mais également social-démocrate, travailliste, etc.)""

Peeing standing up spreads urine all over the place, while sitting down contains it all in the toilet. Standing to pee in your own home is unnecessary. Therefore it is disrespectful unless you are the one that always cleans the bathroom.

t1_epnoubb,-2,t3_bvbrkm,moloydey,funny," Is HUMOR at workplace really necessary? 

Steve Goodier said:- ""Humor can make a serious difference. In the workplace, at home, in all areas of life - looking for a reason to laugh is necessary. A sense of humor helps us to get through the dull times, enjoy the good times, and manage the scary times.""   

Here are 10 ways you can incorporate humor at your workplace: 

1. Bust a Move Together: Better yet, have a 3pm dance party. 

2. Take Aim: Post up a dart board; have a tournament. 

3. Score a Touchdown: Play paper football while waiting for a meeting to start.

Just because someone has the right to migrate doesn’t mean that they will have a guaranteed, enjoyable life waiting for them. Many places are reluctant to just letting people become citizens. And if someone flees a home country for one reason, say drug influence with cartels and gangs, then that can’t be the same reason for wanting to leave a country again....as that’s why you left the original place. It’s likely that those who cross the borer, illegally, just want to be with their families yes, but that’s not a guarantee so that’s why we need a stronger border to make it a guarantee that this person is safe to our society. I know the process may be long but that’s why it’s their, to make sure they aren’t going to be a threat. Many people want to keep them out regardless but that’s not reasonable at all. Should we give asylum? Yes, but through a thorough process of information.

TLJ has more pushes to make the EU canon than any other film. Almost every single line is a reference. It's like... The most meta film ever.

Many Star Wars fans, just like any group of people, are stupid. That's just... An unfortunate truth of being human.

Did you ever see a Snoke theory that wasn't eye-rollingly cringey? HE'S THE EMPEROR RETURNED! HE'S REY'S DAD! HE'S NOT DEAD, IT'S ALL A SETUP TO BRING REY TO THE DARK SIDE!

Like... They were overwhelmingly bad. And some of them got HUGE responses.

I've been a Star Wars geek since seeing the first movie at 3. Played (own) all the games, even the godawful 8-bit ones. Read all the books (though I'm currently behind). Watched every single film, excluding Solo, in theatres (illness. Long story), most at the midnight release. I freaking LOVE Star Wars. 8 is probably my favorite of the entire series (cue the down votes into oblivion). It's the first one that actually felt like Star Wars again, after the prequels' push on George Lucas's attempts at merchandizing.

VIII was about the little guys fighting in the face of overwhelming odds with a tiny shred of hope. Think about it: since the end of Episode V, has any film felt like the rebellion could lose? In VII, we still feel like the rebels are the bigger, stronger team.

Almost every ""flaw"" people name about Episode VIII is fully explained.

Leia was shown as Force sensitive in V. And VI. And is explained to be the daughter of one of the most powerful Jedi ever.

No general is going to tell Poe more than his flight mission. Period. The rebellion was built on turning Imperials. High ranking General Crix Madine is a turned imperial special operative. Spies exist. When you think you're compromised, you DEFINITELY don't tell people who just failed to follow orders, leading to the destruction of your entire bomber fleet.

The Holdo Maneuver required shields that literally only the Raddus has.


Canto Blight is important for a number of reasons, a huge one being that Finn didn't actually get the chance to learn why he's fighting in the hot mess that is Episode VII.


My wife and I literally came skipping and jumping out of TLJ because it was AWESOME. Then we found out so many fans hated it. And we watched the storm of hate. And we watched Rian Johnson troll jerks.

I am a strong believer that making fun of people trying to ruin the fun is a good thing, and that's exactly what I see from Johnson, as he made fun of trolls and angry folks who wouldn't listen to anything said.

I get that we have vastly different perspectives here, but I have one final point: this is the biggest betrayal? This was the makers attacking the fans? I have an interview from my LD or VHS copies of the original trilogy you should watch, where Lucas explains Star Wars wasn't the film he set out to make and that he would change it as much as required until HE was happy with it. And he repeatedly kept fans from getting the original trilogy on... Anything. Getting a theatrical release is impossible. The closest we can get is the updated title scrawl version. Lucas wouldn't even let you be a fan of what he made, telling you your opinion was wrong for liking it like that.

Hopefully I haven't come off grumpy or anything, as I'm honestly trying to be earnest, despite the difficulty involved with the Internet",1549567681

No that wasn't the Catholic argument. The Catholic view is that the Bible is a complex collection of books written by people inspired by God. So you can't use a non-fiction perspective when reading Genesis because that wasn't the intent of that book. Those bad verses are seen as bad out of context in a vacuum but that's not how they were written as. 

> IF this is a divinely inspired work but it still requires the very flawed decision on man in which verses are truly rules and which are just mistakes or analogies then it's really not a reliable guide to any kind of action or belief. 

Through divine inspiration the writers were able to write with the intent of God in mind. So again, if you read it within the right framework it does give us the word of God.

> And if a benevolent all knowing God allowed this to be created and used to such ends as it has then that's clearly not a very loving or moral God.

Here's one from THIS MONTH:

https://www.computerworld.com/article/3387141/reliable-reports-of-blue-screens-after-installing-this-weeks-win10-1809-patch-kb-4490481.html

Microsoft fired their QA team for Windows Update.  Windows Update is now the most common cause of BSODs, crashes, and hardware faults on the computers I work on.  I usually end up setting up a task scheduler to disable the Windows Update service, and only re-enable it for a 2 week period once a year.  Works out to be about the same as LTSC, and bonus, it gives Microsoft a chance to fix their shitty updates before the user is forced to install them.

I mean just go on /r/sysadmin any day of the week ffs.  You must not work in IT if you think Windows Update is the *solution* to all your crashes and bugs.

t1_epuoyfm,-3,t3_bvylxq,Ambitious5uppository,funny,"No fire code I'm aware of says this (though I won't say there isn't a jurisdiction somewhere that has this as a rule, albeit impractical). According to the international fire code the main door to the building is permitted to be fitted with a key only locking device, however should be kept in the unlocked position when the building is occupied.

Using a key only lock prevents criminals from locking themselves inside the building with targets and slowing emergency response access.

There is no or limited risk to death by use of a key only lock when kept in the unlocked position while the building is occupied, such as on the front door of a store. Having it locked only when the building is unoccupied is no different to having an openable lock, with a security gate pulled down and padlocked infront of the door, either way you're not getting out, and both are permitted. 

It is also permisible to fit a key only lock on the main exit door, and to have the door remain locked while occupied, if there is an emergency egress device fitted, such as an automatic unlock from the frame side of the lock upon the trigger of an alarm, or by the press off an emergency egress button near the door. In this case the door should have a sign to state that it remains locked and to exaplain how to unlock. In commercial buildings open to the general public, you'll mostly only see these on jewellery stores and banks where they will unlock it for you, but in an emergency you can unlock it yourself, possibly with a time delay. 

It is also permissible for unmonitored exits, such as dedicated fire escape doors to be fitted with a time delay before the door unlocks, so long as the door is fitted with a sign to state the delay. Which allows for shops to prevent grab and run theft through unmanned doors. 15 seconds is permitted without application, and 30 seconds can be permitted with approval requested.

Though your suggestion would have made this scene a lot less dramatic :)

As a result you get less use of the nutrients in your food and are more hungry as a result. The long term effect is increased insulin resistance which can lead to type 2 diabetes. 

Other sweeteners like stevia do not cause the same insulin response due to it being 200 times sweeter than sugar by weight.",1557152445

Those that can learn are guided to learn by being given homework. Learning a subject does not really occur in the classroom.I am quite happy that I did not have to stay in the Public Education System. Most teachers enter the career with the right attitude and a poor skill set. Our society(you) ha splaced so many demands and constraints on the education system(teachers) that it is a quagmire. From EVERY damn person should be mainstreamed into a classroom with ""normal"" children, to the massive amount of information every teacher is expected to teach every student.My last year in Public high School teaching I had to eat with the students because the most admired teacher was quite free with how she was so admired to the staffroom lunch tables...

I give those that try a ""B, and I give anyone that shows up for class and stay awake a ""C""... those that sleep get a ""D"", and those that do not show up get an ""F"".

But on the other hand, I know other people who have guns that most definitely should not have them. I think it perhaps comes down to what the gun was designed to be used for.

Designed for killing people = illegal gun

Designed for hunting animals = legal gun?

But then there would be loopholes with companies just saying that their semi-auto hand gun was designed to be a quick-draw gun for hunting birds. And we saw in the VT shooting what can be done with semi-auto handguns.

t1_favc8yo,-6,t3_eahe0q,OddfellowJacksonRedo,funny,"Actually talk to a few hotel staff around the convention center. They have to constantly be wary during that weekend of cleaning rooms or changing out linens and towels because a lot of these jerks leave used steroid needles in the trash or on the floors, sometimes even on the beds. Diuretics and laxatives they sometimes will chug for fast water weight loss means some hotel folks have found shit- and puke-soaked handtowels lying in the bathrooms.

One friend of mine is an LMT who worked in-house at a spa for one of the more popular hotels and remarked that she tended to call in sick during those days unless desperate for money, because these folks will buy massage sessions but come in late, still demanding their full time of course even if there’s a scheduled backlog. They come unshowered, oiled, maybe some of them so doped up on crap they’re literally sweating some of it out of their pores, give the massage therapists flak about being asked to shower first, the whole gamut of shit.

My wife worked as a dancer for Columbus Gold for a few years and these people would come in after the day’s events and just be the loudest, most problematic customers in the club and of course be the crappiest tippers who, if they DID buy drinks or dances, were the nastiest grab-assers. Bouncers often looked the other way and left girls basically at their mercy because they didn’t want to go enforce the rules and risk getting into a fight with a guy and his table of fellow beefheads.

Like any other event or community there are indeed some perfectly fine people amongst them. But overall they represent an annual headache for most service and entertainment staff in town. They go spend money eating at a restaurant so owners love it; for the actual employees having to clean up after them and deal with their roid-raged ego trips while getting little to no respect or tips, not so much.

They bring money into the city—or at least a couple square blocks of it—every year and everybody around it loves that it gives an anchor connection to “Auhnold,” who then can be enticed to do local car dealership and gym TV ads. But no, by and large a lot of these attendees are in fact hurting some folks when they come swaggering and hollering around here.

PS: one last fun tidbit that’s been getting more news notice the last few years: the Arnold Classic weekend is when the police and local human rights advocacy groups note that human trafficking and sex worker exploitation activity shoots through the roof. Not simply prostitution—sexual assaults, rapes, and solicitation or sexual assault on minors—it all is like a Wild West weekend of scum and villainy. And again, why does a bunch of it go under the rug? Because money talks and muscle-shirt-wearing shit walks.",1576357580

In the back seat of their van was an inflate-a-mate. Her mouth open as if she were stuck in this everlasting never ending orgasimic scream.

t1_f38qiej,-16,t3_dg17ly,DiamondPup,funny,"Not in my experience.  A buddy of mine became vegan a few years back on account of his girlfriend going vegan (they watched the movie 'what the health' and were convinced by it apparently).  They have since:

 - preached to us a few times (out of the blue and unrelated to the conversation) about the morality of veganism and the treachery of the meat industry

 - while my buddy isn't bad, his gf used to gag and complain when someone ordering a steak or burger around her.  And not subtle gagging; loud and obnoxious, and making choking sounds.  And openly claimed the smell of cooked meat makes her gag (which was someone's meal).

 - start conversations up regularly out of the blue when we're all talking about history or science or topics of that nature, about how the human body isn't designed for meat and milk and how it's unnatural.

 - most times we plan a get together at a restaurant, she will shoot down any places we offer to go to and when asked where we can go that is vegan friendly, just complains that there is 'not enough vegan options in the city'.  

 - my buddy isn't as bad as his gf is but even he tends to use lull periods in conversations to talk about how ""weird"" it is that humans drink the milk of another creature.

I know what you'll say: that these people are exceptions and anomalies and most vegans aren't like that.  But, frankly, I've known 4 vegans in my life and they've all been variations of this.  All of them.  The two I mentioned, my friend's sister, and my ex's cousin.  They're the only vegans I've ever known and they were all the stereotype to a tee.

Again, you can say that I'm the anomaly here since it's only in my experience.  And I'm sure I am.  I don't think all vegans are smug or obnoxious, nor do I think veganism is bad or wrong (I actually fully support it and I can always admire someone who changes their life for ethical reasons).  My friends' group has a few vegetarians in it so we're all happy to accommodate and make adjustments for each other, and no one makes fun of someone for their diet or life choices.

This whole stigma of obnoxious vegans isn't something that came up out of the blue; there's a reason this stigma exists.

First, entropy is a concept. It is incapable of feeling consequences. Second, yes, we radiate energy. The problem is that to do so at the rate needed to maintain equilibrium it requires an increasingly higher ambient temperature, e.g., global warming. That increased temperature does have entropic implications that are of consequence to us.

>You aren't knowledgeable or the expert if you honestly believe thermodynamics limits the human population....

And you're an expert? I'm sorry but I'm having trouble hearing you over my PhD in chemical engineering and a decade of experience designing and optimizing chemical systems and processes. Deny it all you want but physical laws do constrain us. Also, you should look into the assumptions both implicit and explicit in the paper you proffered. We'd have to give up everything even remotely worth living for to even get close to what they propose. And for what? So I can be further annoyed by longer lines at Starbucks or more idiots like you pontificating about stuff you know nothing about and making stupid/reckless assumptions on behalf of those of us who do?
