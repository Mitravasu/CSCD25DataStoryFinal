The problem arises when you universally proclaim that it's shameful for a woman to have tattooed breasts. Now you're taking your own subjective opinion, and forcing other people to share it with you.

Hey look, we've got a correction!

**Edit:** Sorry, saw you said 'what or how', not 'why'.

Inverse leveraged S&P 500 and Russell 2000 funds, and long-term T-bill funds.

The inverse leveraged fund goes down $2 every time the stock market goes up $1 and vice versa. The T-bill funds get better as the 10 year T-bill yield goes down. That's the one that just hit 0.5%, down from a record low of 1.3%, in a trading space where 0.05% changes matter.

I didn't time it *perfectly* so the inverse yield stuff is only about 20%. Bit more after today.

The T-bill fund? Yeah, that one is going a little nuts.

This gives me pause. So I looked it up to back up my own ideas about the connotation of ""demand."" ""Request"" seemed too formal, perhaps yes ""ask"" would be more neutral. But he didn't seem like a neutral kind of guy.

One aspect of any society with a wide-based population pyramid (this can be applied to the Dark Ages, modern 3rd-world countries and, yes, ancient to modern hunter-gathering societies) is that though infant mortality rate is high, *once you make it past age 6, you have a pretty good chance of making it to your mid to high 60's*. That's the main reason why poorer societies have more children: So that even if the mortality rate goes as high as 50%, more children will make it to adulthood. Once infant care improves, less babies die, IMR goes down and people have less children, leading to the leaf-shaped pyramid which seems to be the bane of most developed countries' leaders... Except for the US, which is actually an unfortunate thing if you think about it. 

Incidentally, since the debate in the comments seems to be on vaccines, it's probably worth noting that the vaccine-adverse communities seem to follow the redneck group depicted in *Idiocracy*, meaning they're more likely to have more children and larger families... Not just in the US, but also in other places where vaccines are optional. They seem to have the same level of IQ too.",1602819840

Frankly, none of those statistics are particularly impressive, but it does underscore how silly it is to tout this fact about ZZ Top. Bands usually break-up or lose members due to differences of opinion regarding musical direction or the need to get a day job in the face of a lack of success. The more members in the band, the more likely that this will happen. These three bands have evolved very little over the decades and they have all achieved a level of success to obviate the need for a day job.

>One week before Mel Gibson's *The Passion of the Christ* (2004) was released in American film theaters, Hutton Gibson told radio talk show host Steve Feuerstein that the Holocaust was fabricated and ""mostly fictional"".  He said that the Jews had simply emigrated to other countries rather than having been killed, a view which observers described as Holocaust denial.  [Wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutton_Gibson#Beliefs) 

Name one thing against other actors that shows Mel wasn't anymore than a nice guy. He should be treated as a victim of child abuse and lauded for his upbringing not affecting his real-life actions.

t1_gdh8mxo,-2,t3_k09hp4,The_God_of_Abraham,todayilearned,"Well, I don't have to time to rehash this at length for the billionth time, but here's the short version.

* ""Medicare for all"" and ""free"" health care are functionally equivalent terms in colloquial speech, and you're smart enough to know that. They both mean little-to-no direct payments from patients to providers.

* Health insurance companies have profit margins that are lower than most other industries. They have massive *scale*, which makes their profit sound large, but their margins are quite thin. There's no credible argument that insurance administration by government--with, let's face it, less of a culture of efficiency or profit motivation to achieve it--would be substantially cheaper than the current system.

* The only way to significantly cut health care costs is to pay the doctors, nurses, and administrative staff less money. A *lot* less. I wish more advocates would be honest about this. NHS costs, for instance, are lower in large part because they use fewer staff, and they get paid less than equivalent providers in the US.

* What's the tradeoff for paying doctors less? Well, you either keep requirements the same and get fewer doctors, which screws *everyone*, or you reduce the requirements. Less time in med school. Less time in internships. Less time learning specializations. Less well-trained nurses. And so on. It's not impossible--many other countries have significantly less time on training doctors--but it's a *huge* cultural and logistical shift that would take decades to implement and settle.

* You also have to have legal reform that reduces doctors' malpractice liability. Malpractice insurance is very expensive, because people can get seven-figure payouts for what may in the end just be bad luck. Surgeons pay ~$50,000 a year just to cover their asses. 

* There's a full length argument for pharmaceuticals as well, but the upshot is that if you pay less for drugs, you'll get fewer new drugs. Simple as that. Is that an OK tradeoff? Maybe. But every benefit has a cost.",1606248435

Who was Vice President in 1988?

Most of what was due to be released in 2017 were supposed to be released thanks to the he JFK Assassination Records Collection Act, which George HW Bush signed into law back in 1992. That put all the assassination records in one place in the National Archives. 

Why is that relevant?

Please explain how these two documents simultaneously exist in the world:

[One, a Hoover memo talking about George Bush being in the CIA long before he ever admitted it.](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bush_Sr,_JFK_-_J_Edgar_Hoover_memo_2.jpg)  

The CIA said it was a different George Bush, but [George William Bush said it *wasn't* him.](https://aarclibrary.org/notices/Affidavit_of_George_William_Bush_880921.pdf).

[Second, a memo establishing a weird quasi-alibi at the same time.](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bush_Sr_tip_on_JFK_1963.jpg)

Of course Bush was in the CIA before he ever admitted it, because of his work with Zapata Oil which was clearly a CIA front to supply weapons for the Bay of Pigs invasion.

But the crazy doesn't stop there. His father, [Prescott Bush, this kingmaker](https://static.businessinsider.com/image/4fb0f206eab8eaa30f000007/image.jpg), [was on the board of Union Bank when the bank's assets were seized by the United States government on October 20, 1942 during World War II under the U.S. Trading with the Enemy Act and Executive Order No. 9095.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Banking_Corporation)

Because the Union Bank of New York was a Nazi bank.

Okay, and since we're going down the tinfoil lined lane... you see that picture of Prescott Bush with Nixon?  You know who Jack Rubenstein (a/k/a Jack Ruby) worked for in Chicago, before moving to Dallas and becoming a proprietor of gentleman's clubs?  If you guessed one Richard Milhouse Nixon, you'd be correct.

So, I'm not sure where we draw the line at regular shenanigans of the CIA and all of this, but it's all there in the declassified documents.  Just read them...

Why did J. Edgar Hoover go out of his way to personally write a memo about the assassination of JFK that says essentially, ""dunno, go ask George Bush?""",1606627602

Just because you treat everyone equally like shit doesn't make it unfair - it just means you haven't been nut checked yet for it. WW2 was a global nut check. It'd be fucking foolish to act like it wasn't.

While I know you didn't say this, I am going to addres something else: It's not 'facism apologisism' in another post, it's not. It's context. Hitler did see his friends die in an explosion right in front of him. His experiences in WW1, and the treaty after are what shaped him into the monster he later became, and because of the extreme poverty Germany faced due to losing the war AND from being forced to pay for everyone, there's a damn good reason why we don't make treaties like that.",1601273165

This year, the radical islamists were stirred up *again* by charlie hebdo, who is operating under the umbrella of freedom of the press and posting things designed to trigger violent responses - the government is then appearing to be on the side of the people and freedom by offering to re-educate muslims, even though we're talking about the actions of the furthest of far right muslims.

They put fifteen thousand muslims on a terrorist watchlist this decade and deported only 250 of them. They have six million muslims living in france and have had only a very small handful of attacks. heinous though they may be, the people committing these atrocities are not *statistically* representative of islam. The numbers are just too low.

It's the same bad faith anti-islamist rabble rousing that america had after 9/11. The greatest antidote to radical islamist views is just to live alongside Muslims and show them that you're capable of coexisting. This is supported by polls of Muslims from European states versus polls of Muslims from Muslim majority states - Muslims in diverse countries are much less likely to support sharia law for non Muslims and death for apostates.

I will personally state though that Fox News is responsible for Trump being unaccountable, but that networks like CNN and MSNBC are responsible for electing Trump. They are responsible because they gave him every minute of attention and inadvertently gave him hours upon hours of free coverage.

If we want to go even further, women should be put through the same standards as men if they want a combat role. It's stupid that the military is getting politicized.

After WWI (then called The Great War) many Americans had decided they wanted nothing to do with a foreign war and there was no reason for Americans to die for other countries.

FDR was secretly providing some aid to Britain. The government really wanted to be in the war and helping our allies. We know it was going badly for them. But we also knew the American public wouldn't stomach it.

The aircraft carrier that sunk at Pearl Harbor is one the Navy had requested to replace. Congress wasn't willing to authorize funds to scrap it and replace it.

Anybody who says any system is perfect is a fucking moron. That being said, communism does not assert itself as perfect in any way, never has.

It asserts that:
>Communism is a specific stage of socioeconomic development predicated upon a superabundance of material wealth, which is postulated to arise from advances in production technology and corresponding changes in the social relations of production.

That is cited as being drawn from Marx's own Critique of the Gotha Program. That's it, that's communism. Communist schools of thought differ pretty wildly on how to bring that about, and on exactly how a communist society should look.

That's also why it is commonly asserted that communism has never been tried, because we have never reached that stage of development. Do note that:

>The term communist society should be distinguished from the Western concept of the communist state, the latter referring to a state ruled by a party which professes a variation of Marxism–Leninism.

Also you should also take note of the fact that the ideals you are accusing of being false are boiled down to simply a classless, stateless, moneyless society. None of that is inherently false, and can't be in the same way capitalism can't be called ""false ideals"".",1589545844

From the experience of three revolutions we know that out of every 100 decisions taken by individual persons without being tested and corrected collectively, approximately 90 are one-sided. In our leading body, the Central Committee of our Party, which directs all our Soviet and Party organizations, there are about 70 members. Among these 70 members of the Central Committee are our best industrial leaders, our best co-operative leaders, our best managers of supplies, our best military men, our best propagandists and agitators, our best experts on state farms, on collective farms, on individual peasant farms, our best experts on the nations constituting the Soviet Union and on national policy. In this areopagus is concentrated the wisdom of our Party. Each has an opportunity of correcting anyone's individual opinion or proposal. Each has an opportunity of contributing his experience. If this were not the case, if decisions were taken by individual persons, there would he very serious mistakes in our work. But since each has an opportunity of correcting the mistakes of individual persons, and since we pay heed to such corrections, we arrive at decisions that are more or less correct.

Of course, in order to build something new one must economize, accumulate resources, reduce one's consumption for a time and borrow from others. If one wants to build a house one saves up money, cuts down consumption for a time, otherwise the house would never be built.

We built it for the sake of real personal liberty, liberty without quotation marks.

While learning to speak English is one of the hardest languages to learn due to there being so many idioms and different slang that is localized. Learning to read and write English compared to other languages is relatively easy.

Simply put English, while not being the best language, I would go for either German, Hebrew, or Latin for that title, it is arguably better than the vast majority of languages out there.",1591023659

The most common usage by people is to say when something is going to happen, and most things people discuss on a daily basis are within the same year.   We also already know what year it is because it only changes every 365/6 days.

So leaving the year until last when we write a date is often more efficient, with a few exceptions.  

The problem, is that we get into habits and carry those habits with us when we label files in a computer, or write a date into a database.   Often times when we collect a group of dates, it becomes necessary to organize them but by then, we often already entered the dates into the computer with our “worse” method.  

So!   That’s my take on it. 

TLDR: YYYY-MM-DD is actually better in computers but us silly humans enter the dates into the computer in the worse way, by default.  (either MM-DD-YYYY/YY or DD-MM-YYYY/YY)",1591117016

It doesn't matter where the merge happens as long as it's not at the end of the lane where brakes need to be used.

Let's assume a normal hourly employee. 52 weeks a year times 40 hours a week equals 2080 hours. Let's say the employer is generous and offers 4 weeks paid time off. Now we're down to 1920 hours that the employer expects you to work every year.

If we take that to a salaried employee, the rules change a little if they make enough to be exempt, but it's largely the same. When I take PTO, I base it on an 8 hour day. When I accrue 5 hours of PTO per paycheck, it's really more like 62.5% of a day.

 ""Gen-Xers"" (which they called ""13ers"", describing them as the thirteenth generation since the US became a nation). The book asserts that 13ers' location in history as under-protected children during the Consciousness Revolution explains their pragmatic attitude. They describe Gen Xers as growing up during a time when society was less focused on children and more focused on adults and their self-actualization.[32][33][31]

Gen X was known as the latchkey kids because they arrived home after school.  Both parents worked because women had moved into the work force AND because the horrible economy force both parents to work.  As a result, Gen X as a generation he a strong independent streak.



They credited increased parental attention and protection for these positive changes. They asserted Millennials are held to higher standards than adults apply to themselves and that they're a lot less vulgar and violent than the teen culture older people produce for them. They described them as less sexually charged and as ushering in a new sexual modesty, with increasing belief that sex should be saved for marriage and a return to conservative family values. They predicted that over the following decade, Millennials would transform what it means to be young. According to the authors, Millennials could emerge as the next ""Great Generation"". 


I think they completely wiffed on this prediction.  The increased parental attention led this generations parents to be called ""Helicopter Parents"". There was a big change in parenting that stressed building up your child's self esteem.  The constant protection of the kids self esteem led to a soft generation that can't stand to hear opposing points of view and who needs safe spaces.  There's a good chance one of them will prove that point with a simple ok boomer.

The prediction that they would be less sexually charged and ""return to conservative family values"" is wrong too.  The prevalence of hook up apps like Tinder proves that wrong.

I'm not disagreeing with the comment above me, he makes a good point about playboy having a sexualised lense, one which can be chalked up to Hefners own outlook on women, which wasn't amazing.

Such rationales are wholly subjective. 

Preemptively invading a neutral country because you think someone else is going to do it first, whether you think it is defensive or not, is still *invading a neutral country*, whatever the excuse.

I find it odd that you feel that Belgium wouldn't defend itself if France invaded first. I'd argue that they would, and would immediately ally with Germany. Just as they did in the reverse in 1914.

Now one of two things are possible, and you get to pick one.

1) The Europeans arrived in the region ~40,000 years ago, and didn't adapt light skin for **30,000 years**, and then suddenly and rapidly evolved light skin in the last 8,000 years with zero evolutionary prompting, perfectly in line with the political agendas of a bunch of 21st century half wits, but completely at odds with everything we know about adaptive natural selection.

Or

2) A non peer reviewed study where even the person who conducted the study admits it's impossible to know, has absolutely no basis for drawing such a conclusion, and the population simply adapted to fairer skin soon after they migrated, much like every other instance of migratory adaption we know of, and perfectly in line with the fact that *the people you're describing are the lightest skinned haplo group on the planet*.

What another comment just enlightened me to is that a pawn shop gets an FFL02 which opens them up to getting registered as a SOT (special occupational taxpayer) which is the thing that lets them deal in NFA firearms.

Allied ships were allowed to dock in argentine ports. This is normal behavior in neutral counties (in practice very few allied ships appear to have used irish ports causing significant problems for ireland).

>, and any Allied airmen and sailors who ended up stranded in Ireland were simply allowed to escape into Northern Ireland 

""Any"" is false. Some were allowed with the level of tolerance for such escapes varying over time. In practice this was a pragmatic responce to the problem that could only hold so many airmen before britan decided it was worth the fallout to liberate them.

>I am not going to begrudge the Irish for displaying a few useless tokens to uphold their facade of neutrality to protect their shipping and stop the Luftwaffe from bombing Dublin back into the stone age.

The Irish went well beyond a facade. They made a reasonably effort to be genuinly neutral. The Irish merchant navy was really rather small and bombing Dublin would have been tricky (600 mile round trip from even the closest part of france and much of that over RAF controled areas). 

The only halfway decent justification for irish behavior is that their small economy and limited industrial capacity meant they were never going to be able to provide much of a contribution to the war effort. Their recent history with britian also limited their ability to provide manpower. As a result neutrality is somewhat understandable. Post war actions less so.",1585773424

Example. If you have a job earning 100,000 plus family expenses verses inheriting 2,000,000. This grows more pronounced when you inherit even more. This money has to go somewhere, so it goes into property to generate rents, driving the cost of living of those without capital up further.

People have been starving to death for all of human history. Famine has been one of the few constant threats to humanity forever. Famine not a result of capitalism although capitalist society may/does ignore starvation. That said the USA (a capitalist nation) provides more food as Foreign aid than the next 20 countries combined. 

On the reverse Communism has in the past caused Famines. Example [Holodomor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor) or Terror-Famine in the Ukraine. The communist party intentionally starved the ukrainian people to eliminate a Ukrainian independence movement. They would steal their food and block any foreign aid that tried to enter. 7 million people died of starvation in a country that is known as ""the breadbasket of eastern Europe"".  

>I've merely pointed out that capitalism has killed way more people than communism ever has.

This is just the most incorrect statement you could make. Between 60-110 million people were killed by communist regimes in the 20th century alone and continues today in places like north Korea and China.",1612241175

1) You were not specific enough, not for me, but for basic reading comprehension.

2) An opinion piece by, admittedly, the Chairman of the Federalist Society's Board of Directors, is not necessarily the opinion of ""The Federalist Society.""

3) If Trump had actually called for delay of the fall election, I would join Calabresi in calling Trump a fascist. But, all Trump did was ask a question. <german accent>Avarently, der are questions dat must not be asked. </german accent> (Actually, a very fascist concept.)

Trump's tweet had an explicit premise, that universal mail in voting is inaccurate and fraudulent (true, the extent of which can be debated...but oddly isn't), an implicit premise that Covid-19 is so awful we have to shut down everything, businesses, schools, churches, private funerals (but not liberal icon funerals), everything (which totally isn't an attempt to destroy the economy to help oust Trump) so in-person voting should be shut down too. He then asked, given these two premises, “Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???” He even triple question marked it for those unclear if it was an executive order, command, plan, suggestion, or simply a question for debate.

The answer is simply, no, we should not delay the election. That was simple. It was one of Trumps typical idiotic, trolling, embarrassing, tweets. The younger generations take tweets way too seriously, it is literally one of the worst forms of communication and discourse.

Should we take everything over a billion dollars from all billionaires and evenly distribute it to all non-millionaire citizens (oops sorry, and non-citizens) in the U.S.? The answer is no. But, it would be a fun topic to debate the utter stupidity of the suggestion. I guess by asking the question and applying Calabresi’s logic which you seem to have adopted, I’m now some kind of left wing socialist. Where do I pick up my free Che shirt?

4) I’m hardly a Trump cultist, he’s (see how the pronoun follows the noun) an immoral buffoon and needs to shut up and stop tweeting, except for the fun fact that his tweets so annoy the left, they are a constant embarrassment to our nation.

# FAQ

## What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

## Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.

## Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right",1597081356

Lebanon's system isn't meant to exalt certain groups, but to prevent those groups from killing each other. Which is understandably given higher priority than equal rights for small minorities.

There's been military reports of UFOs flying into military airspace, arming all the warheads under their control, and then disabling them. Under the assumption that an alien species with malintention exists, it wouldn't need us to disarm ourselves. The automatic assumption that the unknown or unfamiliar is automatically dangerous is the crux of human error and the basis of racism and prejudice. The way I see it, look at how humans treat fellow humans just because of difference in skin color, religion, ideology, etc. In the case of an alien species revealing itself to us, sure, maybe we would be excited and accepting at first, but looking at human history so far, there's no doubt it would end in disaster. Considering how we treat fellow humans based on minuscule differences, imagine how we would treat a species of equal or greater intelligence that has had much more time to evolve and would presumably have drastically different appearances to us. 

PLEASE IGNORE THE REST OF THIS COMMENT UNLESS YOU ARENT OVERLY SENSITIVE AND IRRATIONALLY CLING TO YOUR BELIEFS WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT... everything below this is a personal rant about my opinion, above is just theory conjectured from actual knowledge based on human history.

That's the problem with these ""anti racism"" organizations, pointing out the differences in humans will only ever continue to divide us. Instead we should be slowly ignoring and forgetting words like ""black and white"" in relation to skin color until they mean nothing. Until the thought of referencing someone as black or white doesn't make any sense because the color of a person's skin doesn't mean anything. Instead organizations like BLM (while noble and respectful in theory) continue to bring increased attention to the ""differences"" between people of different skin color. Therefore giving actual racists more fuel.

Just because an animal can respond to pain and try to avoid it doesn't mean it ""suffers"" or has an emotional response in the way that humans do. Humans can contextually relate their painful situation to the possibility of death, and the consequences of death. 

If I pulled out a knife and stabbed a cow, the cow's going to freak out because it hurts to get stabbed and the cow knows it. But once it stops hurting the cow doesn't sit down and look at the stars to think about its mortality and the implications of it's possible death. Maybe it'll start going to church more often. Maybe buy a life insurance policy to take care of the baby cows in the event of another unfortunate incident.

> Starting from some back of the envelope numbers we can work through. N_vocab = 20k words and let's use N_words = 26^6 = 308,915,776 as a proxy for possible word choices. We'll try to calculate the probability of no overlaps or P(No coincidences).Thinking about the number of combinations we only have to insure that any word is different in the two languages:


> Numerator = (N_words) * (N_words - 1) *  (N_words - 1) * ... * (N_words - N_vocab + 1) * (N_words - N_vocab)

> **Pairing up similar terms we have:**


> Numerator = N_words * (N_words - N_vocab) * (N_words - 1)^2 * ... * (N_words - N_vocab + 1)^2




> **Since N_words >> N_vocab:**

> (N_words - N_vocab)^2 ~= N_words^2

> **Applying to the first expression:**


> Numerator ~= N_words^(2 * N_vocab), for N_words >> N_vocab

> **So we have a numerator of P(No coincidence). The denominator is just the total number of combinations regardless of overlap:**

> Denominator = (N_words)^2 * ... * (N_words - N_vocab + 1)^2

> **But by the same approximation we can re-write when N_words >> N_vocab to be:**

> Denominator ~= N_words^(2 * N_vocab)

> **Which tells us that:**

> P(No coincidences) => 1 as N_words - N_vocab => infinity since the numerator and denominator converge. Since P(Coincidence) = 1 - P(No coincidences) => P(Coincidence) = 0 for N_words >> N_vocab

> **TLDR: As the number of possible words grows far larger than the size of the vocabulary virtually all word assignments are non-overlapping**",1613859287

2. (also 8) Other companies are waiting longer to release a product and that is actually a bad thing. Since Tesla cars collecting data all the time they are out driving around, Tesla effective has an order of magnitude more time being spent in terms of how much testing they're able to do.

3. (and 4 and 5 and 6 and 7) I think you're overestimating how gung-ho Telsa will be with this tech. The cars will be technically capable of L5 years before Tesla will actually take liability away from the driver. The cars make decisions based on what they see on the road even when the cars aren't in autopilot, so when they do finally start driving they've already been tested for years and years.

My comment is going more towards their priorities. In a place where civil liberties are still up in the air, to choose to legalize a plant instead of even trying to address the human rights issues is short-sighted and foolish.

I would say that given the weight of the American conservative movement, and that she was a major influence on it (in however twisted a fashion for some of them) that Rand's cultural significance or lack thereof is a matter of time.

Get us a century removed from the ""Reagan Revolution"" and we'll know more.  A philosopher doesn't become ""highly regarded"" because of any empirical standard.  They become read because they were an influence on the thinking of their age.

At the moment, the Republicans seem more in line with Nietzche or Gentile ... but if the Goldwater / Rockefeller / Greenspan crowd becomes ascendant again, Rand would be the Patron Saint of that movement.

Germany, from 1930 to 1939, and the rise of the Nazi party. Had someone punch Hitler in the face when he first started spouting his hateful rhetoric... it's possible all of this could have been avoided. 

But no one did. No one one stood up and said ""This is wrong!"" in enough numbers to matter. Certainly no one stood up and reacted violently to the changes that were happening in any significant numbers. 

So while we might have some 'growing up' to do. I encourage you to go back and learn more about history. There comes a point when violence IS the only answer and if used sooner could have possibly made things better. 

There is a difference between free speech, and freedom from association. If you associate yourself with a genocidal faction, you should be treated as if you are, quite literally, part of that genocidal faction. To do otherwise is to ignore history. 

This isn't about punching a Republican in the face. This is about punching a genocidal, baby crucifying, raping, torturing, enslaving, fascist member in the face. They are very, very different degrees. Your enlightened attitude means nothing when the toddlers are having their skin melted off and their lungs burned from the hot air as their mother is getting her skull blasted open by a machine gun... after she had been raped for hours. 

I have no mercy for a Nazi. I view them as an existential threat to me, my family, my children, and my country. Because they quite literally are.

t1_g8n22dt,-4,t3_j9s7rb,Cetun,todayilearned,"I think they are saying it was a norm, not necessarily moral. Back then society was more conservative, so everything having to do with sex was bad, even illegal. Hell sex between unmarried persons, cohabitation, oral, anal, homopsexual sex, all of that was illegal. However, criminal justice was different back then and the social fabric of society was also different especially in mostly rural south. People had sex all the time even though they weren't married, people cohabitated, even homosexuality was practiced and most people knew who was doing what, these laws weren't designed to be enforced so much as they were to virtue signal. Not to say these laws were never enforced, just if you were a local union leader and the guy who owns the mill down the road is good friends with the sheriff he will get the sheriff to go over to your house and arrest you for cohabitating with your girlfriend, it was a tool of oppression more than it was an actual thing people thought should be enforced. The mill owner himself could be gay and people around town can know about it but so long as the mill owner doesnt make anyone more powerful than him mad, hes fine. 

Sawing that, sex between a married man and a 15 year old girl was probably known about, and that man was probably shunned and shamed, but just like all the other sex laws most people saw it as a moral failing whos appropriate punishment was social derision rather than criminal charges. So basically people knew it was bad back then but a lot of bad things weren't dealt with through the police unless you tried to challenge the status quo. So the ""norm"" would be that everyone does all these things regularly, people saw it as immoral but not something that should be addressed by any specific action.

Edit: anything remotely sounding like it's defending pedophilia is immediately pitchforked. Speeding is universally considered bad, you probably consider it bad, not many people would say we should have no laws against speeding, most people speed on the highway. Things can be considered both bad and normal, what we are talking about is norms, in the 50s there was a disconnect between norms and values. Having sex with a 15 year old was considered bad, however when people heard about it they made moral judgements on that person without being too shocked at the act.",1602544640

t1_fgkdgaq,-1,t3_eypxy8,PotatoChips23415,todayilearned,"Well to me it sounds like he isnt ""recovering alcoholic"" anymore 8 years later. Theres a few stages of addiction to drugs that arent superaddictive

1. First try

2. Second try

3. Addiction

4. Recognizing of a problem

5. Full quit

6. Withdrawl ends

7. Urges stop

8. If the drug wasnt super addictive beforehand, you can have it every once in a while as long as you are careful and only use it safely

Drugs that fit this bill are stuff like DXM, DPH, Alcohol, Molly (Take a pill from someone else, dont buy it yourself), Marijuana, Low-level Amphetamines (be very careful about this one!!!)

Drugs that dont: Any opioid, meth, cocaine, ***NICOTINE***, similar drugs regarded as highly addictive

Tips for safe consumption: You do it spaced out and not on a schedule. You take different drugs as well, also not on a schedule. You dont buy it for yourself, never own more than the amount you're taking that time.

What about quitting permanently? This creates a culture that breeds addiction ironically, when someone slips up and takes a drink they lose their streak and therefore they have no reason to keep going and they drink more and this spirals out.",1580863000

In Seattle I could literally walk up to a cop, smoke crack directly in front of him (the crack part doesn't have to be part of ""protests"", that's an every day thing) and go light a building on fire, and as long as I'm a part of a terrorist left wing mob, nothing at all will happen to me.

Literally these ""protesters"" do not believe in the first amendment, they attack people who try to film. When a city council member votes the wrong way, they protest the council member, even if defunding the police by 50% with no plan what so ever was passed by a 7-2 veto proof majority. 

Can't have someone think for themselves, can't have someone not pass what ever ludicrous demands the terrorist mobs have (in Seattle polls 90% support police reform, but less than 40% support defunding the police by 50%). They will literally cave to anything anyone on the left want's if they threaten to burn buildings down.

Didn't stop him from supporting his subordinate Frick in breaking the amalagaded association of steel & iron workers union strike, culminating in the 1892 Homestead massacre. 

Carnegie publicly supported unions and the working man, privately he single handedly broke the back of steelworkers unions to the point of them not reemerging till the New Deal era. 

He demanded 12 hour work days, and this is prior to weekends being a thing. He paid on a sliding scale tied to the current price of steel. 

As to his charity, to quote a steelworker from the time, [""After working 12 hours, what man can go to a library""](https://books.google.com/books?id=hyhJAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA221&lpg=PA221&dq=%22after+working+twelve+hours+how+can%22&source=bl&ots=vjWk0-gEVp&sig=ACfU3U1l6RVlcvTpJgOrM60l9kgKDafd0A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjDksXQ9L_jAhVsUN8KHUpdBLoQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22after%20working%20twelve%20hours%20how%20can%22&f=false). Referenced source then goes on to explain how the job was so physically demanding it broke men by their mid 30's, stating he'd never seen a roller (prominent job in a steel mill) over 40 & that he was old at 36, knew old rollers but all were gone (dead). 

This is a very morally grey area - just because Carnegie build libraries & gave away, well damn close to 3 Jeff Bezos's, does not absolve him from the means and methods used to obtain that fortune. 

Capone was a gangster. He filled a demand created by poor policy (prohibition). He was a violent criminal who operated outside of the law & had an interesting ~10 year run. 

Carnegie directly or indirectly hurt & killed thousands for every one victim of Capone via the methods he ran his mills. 

Capone shaped a city during prohibition. His violence was more direct. 

Carnegie's charity cannot undo what he did to American steelworkers.

In terms of sheer damage to human lives, the difference between Carnegie & Capone is the anecdotal ""what's the difference between a millionaire & a billionaire? - about a billion dollars"". 

Neither is a saint. Carnegie did far more harm. The scale is magnitudes of order different between the two.

How has evolution given us WiFi and airplanes? 

Evolution is completely debatable. You’ve just demonstrated you don’t really understand science with the stupidest comment I’ve seen related to since since some guy said we had “done all the science on the moon”.  A hundred years ago we thought the universe was in a constant state. Lemaître, Hubble, etc. had to debate that it wasn’t. We thought the Earth was constant. It took Wegener and others half a century of debate to convince people otherwise. 

>And 1 second of evolution is still evolution

Seconds aren’t units of evolution. That’s like saying a kilogram of evolution. 

>Where is this arbitrary millions of years coming from that you feel you need is necessary to prove it exists?

This thing called the scientific method. And what I’m specifically referring to is natural selection. It isn’t the same as evolution.  

>It's why kids look like their parent

No, that’s genetics. Gregor Mendel figures that out. 

>why we can breed plants and puppies

Sexual reproduction isn’t the same thing either. 

>why we can engineer a mosquito to turn its entire species infertile

Which we currently can’t and is genetic engineering. That also the same thing. 

>we still have plenty of evidence to support it's been going on for billions of years.

Show me evidence of genetic engineering for billions of years.

No. Frequency is a continuous value, hence there is an infinite number of perceptible frequencies within the audible range. So your claim doesn't make sense.

Sure. But...

I raised the point of infinite time signatures. Expanding on that, there **is** an infinite number of combinations of (even a finite set of) frequencies in various lengths and sequences. You cannot deny that. Is there a point at which the sequence, duration of individual notes, duration of the whole melody etc. becomes absurd? *Maybe*, but again that's totally subjective, and no grounds at all by which to claim it is finite.

Whether you regard it is a language or dialect is frankly a little irrelevant to my point that those were also languages or dialects spoken by people within Spain. Like that is arguing semantics, we both understood what I was saying just like when someone refers to Scots as a langaueg or dialect you understand. They are very closely related and the lines blur.

>	each spoken in their respective nations

They're still spoken... In Spain... 

But in English, Castilian refers to European Spanish. In Europe, afaik, it refers to the version of [Spanish that is the common spoken tongue that derived from the Spanish or Castile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castilian_Spanish), which is what I was saying. I'm not sure why you are arguing that is factually incorrect, there are other dialects of Spanish. Castilian isn't the only Spanish spoken even if Franco wished it was. [Andalusian, as I said, is another big one.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusian_Spanish)

And if you want to argue about the Crown of Castile and Aragon, it becomes irrelevant half a century later when the Habsburgs gain control. Sure, Castilian would've been the main language used, but since a single monarch was the king of Spain, Castile, and Aragon, any distinction you are trying to make between them becomes pointless.

I call specism. People just don’t want to believe that animals can do more than instinctually respond to stimulus, even though we have already proven again and again that they are intelligent enough to do much more.

Plus, Pepperburg’s claims are hardly as absurd as a frog dancing and singing. For example, one claim is that Alex invented names for objects he was unfamiliar with by using words he already knew, such as calling a plantain chip a “banana cracker”, which were two separate foods he was already familiar with. Another claim is that he understood and communicated the concept of zero without being taught it (when she asked him “how many” about something there weren’t any of).

Now, what if movie makers put bears, moose or llamas in The Lion King? Would that look good? 

Would making Baloo a polar bear in The Jungle Book make the story better? Would it contribute or distract from the story and visuals.

How about red haired and blue eyed characters in Mulan or Aladdin?

A magical world doesn't mean a surrealist one. If you create a world and a setting, it should be consistent. Toy Story, Cars, A Bug's Life, Monsters Inc. are all different worlds than the one we live in. And they are consistent in their characters, settings and rules.

I also heard that crime rate is almost zero there and the streets are the safest in the world.

Geniune question because for most countries this is almost impossible since they're either connected via land or via economies. Cuba is an isolated island with a totalitarian communist state so that's easier for them to accomplish without being called xenophobic or whatever.

Bear in mind I'm not xenophobic nor communist, but I'm genuinely curious on the effect of isolation from the rest of the world. 

For example Japan was also an isolated island until the 18th century and got a big boost in terms of economy and technology when they did finally open up. But to this day they have some 'different' cultural aspects reminiscent from that isolationism period.

So when Cuba does finally open up and see some of the 'horrors' of the rest of the world will there be some shift in how they perceive foreigners or in their own internal interaction? Or will they remain true to their roots and still uphold some of it like Japan?

Also since everyone is more or less equally poor right now, will there be a change when some will be disproportionally richer than others, like in the rest of Capitalist world? Same thing also applies even more to North Korea. At least people can come visit freely to Cuba and interact with the average person there, it's a lot harder for North Korean people to interact with people from other countries.

In America and so many other places, prison is not about reform, it's about punishment. Justice is double barreled in America. You don't get progress out of that, you just get more pain.

We have to treat addiction as a mental health problem, not a criminal justice problem. In my opinion. real justice would be preventing more deaths from drunk driving. Harsher penalties don't do that. They further stigmatize addicts, make it more difficult to treat them, and exacerbate the problem. Addicts should be treated, not punished.

My engineering salary out of college in the 80’s was exactly the same dollar amount as new grads get now! Wtf is up with that!? I’ll tell you, government loans allow colleges to charge whatever they want for tuition, ruining the futures of those that take out big loans to afford college for a supposedly brighter future. If the market controlled tuition prices, college costs would still be low. And when you allow unchecked immigration of both high-skilled H1-B visa people, and also low-skilled people, that keeps wages nice and low, right where the corporations want them. And unlimited immigration also drives property prices up, just as investors want. We’re competing against each other for jobs, houses, everything. And as long as you keep importing more workers into America who are more than happy to work for shit wages, we all will make shit wages. Downvote away, but I’ve lived this and I am very sorry that you millennials have to live in this situation, where the rising GDP is great for business, but wages are low and college loans eat your futures.

Look them up.

On January 15, 1994, President Bill Clinton formed the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE). This committee was created to investigate and report the use of human beings as test subjects in experiments involving the effects of ionizing radiation in federally funded research. The committee attempted to determine the causes of the experiments and reasons that the proper oversight did not exist. It made several recommendations to help prevent future occurrences of similar events.

As of 2007, not a single U.S. government researcher had been prosecuted for human experimentation. The preponderance of the victims of U.S. government experiments have not received compensation or, in many cases, acknowledgment of what was done to them

MDMA was used for therapy immediately by a group of psychotherapists and it proved to be an extremely effective tool. 

It was made illegal like many other psychedelic/entactogenic drugs for reasons like- big pharma vetoing them and influencing government, political reasons (Nixon, hippies etc), 

Recently because of the massive increase in the mental health crisis it is regaining popularity again, because it absolutely can be used to help people.

t1_ey9t9x2,-1,t3_cw8yj1,Rose_Beef,todayilearned,"The details I can add are anecdotal but clear to me. It seems to me that the debate was had many, many years ago. The two ladies (very French, very authentic ""grandma"" cooks) were interviewed in the early 80's on CBC. Both have long since passed but they detail the story. The husband of one of the ladies had been making curd cheese his whole life and wasn't selling any. His wife (bless her precious heart) brought some in to the restaurant and they began eating it with fries. The other lady, so the story goes, added a scoop of gravy she'd made. The way they tell it, they made it to get rid of all the cheese but it worked and the truckers began to ask for it by name - something they called *poutine*. Many of the French people in northern New Brunswick are Acadian, who've simply settled on the western side of the province. The Irving in question is long gone, bypassed by the new highway but I can remember the place as a kid in the very early 80:s. It spread from there - and here's the nutty part. My uncle was a trucker, he swore that he brought a sample of the dish to another spot on the Quebec side of the border to another restaurant so they could make it. Since it was on his route, it was easier for him to hit the place rather than go out of his way. That's the story he told until he died many, many years ago. There is zero doubt in my mind, it started at that long-gone trucker diner in New Brunswick.",1566951993

Famines have been happening for most of our history, only recently have they stopped being a normal occurrence in the west (thanks in large part to capitalism). Usually they've been caused by natural causes/disasters (drought, crop failure, plague) and war. Government restriction on trade and such tend to worsen famines but aren't really the causes for them. 

>Ireland was reliant on potatoes because it was the only crop that could feed a family on the tiny amount of land available to the average family.

The potato was a very efficient and reliable crop compared to other crops. No one could have predicted there would be a blight. Most of Ireland was dependent on the potato. 

>Ireland still exported food during the famine because they intended to sell it elsewhere even as people starved to death across the country.

True but this wouldn't have been a problem if not for the many English policies meant to oppress the Catholic Irish majority such as seizing Irish land and giving it to English protestant landlords, banning Catholics from owning land.

But to a kid from the diaspora it's an insult - the exact same things that you get mocked or socially isolated for (eg. Wearing 'different' clothes, ethnic food, religious festivals, folk superstitions) are suddenly cool and ok when white people do it? What your parents do all the time was low class but then suddenly some hipster picks it up and figures out how to market it to white middle America and now they're rich and the folks they got the idea from aren't seeing a dime of the profit.

Somethjng like that - one of my closest friends is Chinese-American and she talks about it a lot.
I think in some cases it's not appropriation but one culture inspiring another, like how a lot of British 60s classic rock bands were inspired by a genuine love of American blues music. But it has to be done with love and genuine appreciation of the thing you're inspired by, not cynically taking something and making a quick buck out of selling it as this brand new cool thing (when it's actually been done for ages by people who didn't have the money/social status to sell it to the mainstream).

EDIT: for those who think my response is overly harsh, 82% of chiropractors surveyed in 2003 said that homeopathic medicine was ""appropriate for the Chiropractic Profession’s Scope of Practice"". Over 50% of them believed that subluxations that block the flow of ""Innate"" are the cause of ALL illness in humans. This is not a few bad eggs. This is what is taught at those lauded 4 year courses. Chiropractics is a field that is so full of frauds and quacks that giving any legitimacy to the name is dangerous to the general public.

If you are good at cracking backs, great... learn to do it as part of physical therapy. But don't call it Chiropractics. That is a term for a dangerous form of ""alternative medicine"" that steals people's money at best, and kills people at worst.

EDIT2: [Here is the list of core beliefs in Chiropractics](https://pureandpowerful.com/welcome/the-33-chiropractic-principles/#speakers), taken from the website of a current Chiropractics conference, citing the originator of the field.

Want to cite that with an actual citation instead of a science blog? Your science blog simple ***states***, but ***never actually proves*** that people are being overdiagnosed. It ***assumes*** that since diagnosis rates are going up, but death rates are staying constant, that this ***must*** mean overdiagnosis. This logic simply doesn't follow the stats. There are many explanations for this. One explanation could be that the rate of successful treatment also increased in the same time span. Another could be that the ratio of younger patients increased, making their likelihood of survival far greater.

It also tries to suggest non-lethal cancer should go untreated.

""That’s nearly 1 in 5 people who were diagnosed with a **lung cancer that wouldn’t have gone on to cause any harm at all in their lifetime.** Researchers working on lung screening know *this is something to be addressed as they test what might balance the harms and benefits of lung screening.*""

Frankly, I think this blog is just posing apologia to try and make it seem like they shouldn't screen as much so that ""Cancer Research UK"" can justify screening less.

>In breast cancer, if 2000 women have the screening, 11 of them will get a cancer diagnosis, but without any treatment, only 1 of them will actually die from the condition.

It’s the way in which historical points like this are used to silence folks speaking out about injustices and cruelties that are still happening today, injustices which have direct linkages to the Atlantic Slave trade and the history of Black subjugation in the United States. Or they’re also used to stoke anti-Arab/anti-Muslim sentiment in an already super hostile global environment.

Black Lives Matter and Native sovereignty groups (among others) in the United States often do their best to support one another in the fight for liberation and justice. The idea that all POC and oppressed peoples are out to show themselves as the ONLY oppressed people is a weird conservative myth. I rarely see folks like this in my life and activism, and they’re largely looked down upon by most people who are working toward intersectional approaches to social justice. And the notion that this has any more relevance in understand the views of most Arab people is absurd. In the same way that I don’t think most white people in the US can look back on slavery and colonial genocide and think that it was a good thing - though some still do...

Why people like myself get so sensitive with regards to discussions of this history is because of threads like this that are full of folks who are often more interested in the #Statement and being edgy to “own the libs lol,” as opposed to understanding the nuances of the history and discussing them alongside other aspects of the historical record. Aside from one person in this thread who has made some corrections, as well as pointing out the factual parts, this seems to have just been a gross opportunity for folks to (not even) subtly point to this as reasoning for racist and xenophobic views/policies.

One is that they were in watchdog mode, that Trump’s coverage was largely negative, that the “bad news” outpaced the “good news.” The second rebuttal is that the media’s role in Trump’s ascent was the work of the cable networks—that cable was “all Trump, all the time” whereas the traditional press held back.

> Neither of these claims is supported by the evidence. Figure 2 shows the news balance in Trump’s coverage during the invisible primary. As can be seen, Trump’s coverage was favorable in all of the news outlets we studied. There were differences from one outlet to the next but the range was relatively small, from a low of 63 percent positive or neutral in The New York Times to a high of 74 percent positive or neutral in USA Today. Across all the outlets, Trump’s coverage was roughly two-to-one favorable.

And

> What about the claim that Trump’s rise was a cable-induced phenomenon—that the traditional press resisted the Trump boom? That claim, like the other one, is not backed by the evidence. Trump was big news in every outlet. From the time of his announcement of candidacy until the end of 2015, he dominated the Republican coverage. His share of the leading contenders’ coverage, summed across the news outlets we studied is shown in Figure 4. Trump received a full third of the coverage. His coverage was nearly twice that of the next most heavily covered Republican candidate, Jeb Bush. And he received two-and-a-half times the news attention afforded Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, or Ted Cruz, and five times that given John Kasich. Moreover, Trump’s share did not differ greatly from one news outlet to the next. He was by far the most heavily covered Republican candidate in each of the eight news outlets in our study.",1547312137

Once I wrote an anonymous letter to my English teacher (the only anonymous letter I've ever written, I know better now) that criticized her for her grading and how I couldn't get higher than a B and how she downgraded all my classmates and refused to offer constructive criticism, the way she would belittle my peers that couldn't write well, etc.

I was immediately accused of having written the anonymous letter because I was the only student who could write so well.  If I wrote so well, why couldn't I get a damn A in English?  I never admitted it, but the school counselor knew that I had written it.  She wasn't evil so I always liked she didn't rat on me.

t1_f7oqsvs,-1,t3_dxasdv,ViskerRatio,todayilearned,"> Actually, expressing mathematical knowledge in English or other natural languages is so awkward and difficult that formal mathematical notation was developed, which is an independent language in and of itself.

I think you have it backwards. Precise and formal definitions of *anything* are difficult in any language. However, concepts are pretty easy. If you listen to people talk about mathematical concepts, they're not talking in weird symbols - they're talking in well-defined phrases.

Part of the reason we have those symbols is to cross linguistic divides.

You can really see this distinction with computer languages, where you have Chinese people who nonetheless understand precisely what ""floating point"", ""for"" and ""if"" mean - despite the fact that they'd be baffled trying to get through a Dick and Jane English language reading primer.

> Typically, the higher the level of maths one is working at the more is expressed in formal notation rather than in spoken language.

Proofs are expressed in formal notation. However, if you read research papers, the only time mathematical notation is used is when introducing or directly referencing a concept the reader would not be familiar with. For example, you're almost never going to find a research paper where someone writes out the mathematical definition of a normal distribution - they'll just say ""this is a normal distribution"".

> I think you're confusing linguistics and literature.

'Linguistics' and 'linguistic ability' aren't really the same thing. Linguistics is the study of language itself and really isn't relevant to the article. 'Linguistic ability' in the context of the article is referring to an individual's ability to express a diversity of concepts - which is very much related to the study of literature.",1573932169

I would give most of it to charitable organizations anyway, so likely the government wouldn't really get much taxes from me.

However, if I imagine someone just like me who tries to give all the money to family like some kind of dynasty, I don't think that is okay and the collective will of our democratically elected officials seems to agree.

Estate taxes aren't there so the government makes more money, they are there to discourage a type of behavior that seems to be more and more common: stockpiling wealth, and giving it all to your family when you die. That behavior really hurts the economy, and seems to generally hurt the people you give all that money to as well.

I want those taxes there as a stop gap to curb bad behavior, even if it affects me. If I had a few billion dollars...I wouldn't care about taxes at all. It's basically be like just another charity to me. This is the ""pay for military, roads, welfare programs, social security, democracy, etc..."" fund in my eyes.",1550874563

How did I pigeon-hole anything? I was replying to a comment that indirectly implied that the situation in America today is the same as it was all those years ago. ''They still don't believe it.'' What's there to not believe? I believe that racists lynched innocent black people. I believe that segregation was real and cruel, that black people had it very hard back in those days. I also believe the situation today is much better than it was during the time the book was written.

Either way, 2 people isn't really enough. You'd need at least 3 or 4 just to negate any particular one of them, and there are also things where it's not a single odd one out who can crash the plane and needs to be outnumbered by others, but instead it's a single odd one out who can save the plane and just needs to be there in order to do it, in which case 3 or 4 people still isn't really safe. Like, if all 3 of them got suddenly incapacitated by something some people are more resistant to than others, it would sure suck to be a more resistant person, struggling to reach the cockpit through a fog of oxygen deprivation or something where you can barely function and you notice everyone else is incapacitated and the pilots must be too, only to waste the last of your energy trying to get through a locked door you never would have had a chance at even in your fullest capacity, all because none of those 3 people in the cockpit happened to be the odd one out that was capable of locomotion and sustained consciousness in whatever emergency situation. So if there were 3 or more people it would still be questionable whether I'd want to have my transportation handled by an organization dumb enough to lock that door from inside the cockpit, but when they add insult to injury by only having 2 people in there so the stronger one can absolutely kill everyone no questions asked, for that reason I'm out.

He was friends with about 15 of those 25. Showed about 10 of those 15 weird shit in school and was only friends with about 3 of the 25 enough to hang out outside of school. 

So best case scenario, I had a 3/25 chance of seeing some weird shit. Worst case, 3/5. He only showed me word shit once. I was not one his 3 close friends. 

But in that 1 time, I guarentee he didnt show me every possible vile thing to exist at that time. Why? Because of a bunch of factors. We dont exist in a vacuum so stop creating scenarios that you say will happen. Sure. It might happen but the odds are pretty low day in a day out. 

Why? Because not every kid is that ""one kid"" and because that one kid isn't in every classroom and isn't showing every other kid something each day. 

Stop acting like that's the case literally 100% of the time. Its probably less than 20%. So act accordingly.

Edit: hell, that kid died in a car accident the next year. If he dies 1 year sooner. I dont see weird shit till high school.

You are supposed to play at a disadvantage. The casino offers something like a 49% chance of winning, and you're supposed to come to the casino expecting this. Counting cards turns it into a different type of game because more information is made.

The inevitable response is for casinos to use uncountable decks, like running 25 decks instead of something like 4.

It's kind of like renting a car to go drag racing up and down the street. That goes against the intention of the rental agreement, and the car rental agency may ban the rental of a car for that purpose.

A white tail buck is somewhere between 200 and 400 pounds of mainly muscle, and it will run quite far if you shoot it, even with a hit that would eventually be lethal.

If you are trying to tell me an AR-15 does less damage than a handgun you are insane.

[Here’s the article. ](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/02/what-i-saw-treating-the-victims-from-parkland-should-change-the-debate-on-guns/553937/)

If you think AR-15s are an acceptable civilian weapon, that’s fine. You are entitled to that opinion. But you are not entitled to claim that they are some scarcely lethal toy. They are designed to kill people. They are quite good at it.

This is because rifle cartridges contain more powder. They go *much* faster to make up for their lower mass. A rifle round carries about twice the energy as a handgun round.

Feel free to do your own research about how much tissue damaged is caused by these two types of weapons. I’ve done mine. [Here’s another link](https://www.quora.com/What-makes-5-56-mm-and-7-62-mm-rifle-rounds-more-powerful-than-9-mm-pistol-rounds-Does-the-bigger-calibre-of-the-pistol-round-make-getting-shot-by-a-pistol-more-damaging) that may be helpful.

But everyone can and should be exercising. 

Yah looking like a Spartan from 300 would be tough and require a cycle of steroids and elite dieting and lifting.

But I lift maybe 5 to 6 hours a week. Have time to work 6 and 7 days a week at work. Spend time with my girlfriend. Cook and clean for the two of us. Read books. Watch shows. Go on dates. Grocery shop. See friends. Nap. Jerk off. I dunno honestly if you want to do something you add it into your day.

Arnold managed to learn English. Work full time as a brick layer. exercise 5 hours a day. Take acting classes 4 nights a week. Keep a clean home. Enjoy his friends and life.

If it's so Impossible then why can so many people do it?

You realize many many of the greats weren't born rich and successful. They worked hard.

Cut back on the 6 hours of phone and tv time a day and you'll find time to learn guitar. Or how to  paint. Or play baseball or hockey. Or go lift weights.

Sitting on your phone making excuses as why you suck and downvoting me will do nothing to change that I am, and many others are succeeding in life. Because we do things.

Not bitch and moan about how I'll never be the best in the world. We all have to begin some where. So get started on that goal and keep at it.

When I was drawing I would draw 30 hours a week. Plus my full time job and my life with my girlfriend.

Being good at something takes time.


Arnold always said he loved to hear xyz thing was impossible. That it couldnt be done. Cause then he could be the first to do it.


Most people sell themselves short. Your not tired your uninspired to pursue your goals.

Dont work a 40 hour work week and not go after other aspirations.


I'm pulling over 50 hours a week at work. Another 5 or 6 in the gym. And can still do other things. 

Maybe my current shape isnt as good as the Spartans from 300 or arnold. Maybe my art isnt as good as the best artists. I dont care. I still go after my goals and damn I'm way happier now then couple years ago when I had your mindset. It's to hard. It cant be done.

t1_ekavw1f,-3,t3_baawo7,CjBoomstick,todayilearned,"The discrepancy between tall and short in the imperial measurement system makes it much easier to use for a length that varies so little, especially in terms of meters.

Instead of, say, 1.6 meters, which isn't even entirely accurate considering the conversion is EXACTLY 1.6002, you can say 5 feet and 3 inches.  
Now, 5 feet 6 inches is very clearly 3 inches taller than 5 feet 3 inches, and an inch is not only a common measure of length, it's also a whole number in this scenario. No fractions or decimals at all. 5 feet 6 inches is 1.6764 meters tall. A difference of three inches is the same as 0.0762 meters. It's just harder to imagine that exact division of a meter. I would even argue that if decimeters were actually used that it would make this difference much easier to imagine.

Another good point, how long did most of EU use Stone to measure weight instead of Kilos? It was just more intuitive for them. It made a ton of sense. ",1554623944
