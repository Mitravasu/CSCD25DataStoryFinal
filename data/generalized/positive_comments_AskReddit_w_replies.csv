t1_fkxlrb7,35131,t3_fl944n,theprinterdoesntwerk,AskReddit,"When I was 17, I worked at a grocery store with a guy named Brian. Normal guy, mid 20s, lil chub. Didn't really think much of him.

One day he tells me about how he lives in an apartment by himself and that his neighbours are absolutely crazy. Like they would yell at him to be quiet, pound against the wall to get him to shut up, even though he wouldn't be doing anything. He would sneeze, and his neighbours would scream at the top of their lungs from next door. It was that bad.

Tbh, I didn't really care much when he was telling me this. I just wanted to go home and not work anymore.

Couple days go by and I noticed that Brian wasn't showing up anymore. Whatever. Didn't think much of that either. A month or two goes by and he finally shows back up to work. So, being the nice friend I am, I asked him where he's been. He tells me he was actually fired because he was in the hospital. I didn't think that was a valid reason to fire someone, but what do I know. I didn't comment on that. I asked him why he was in the hospital and he told me it was for ""personal reasons"". I tell him it was good having him back, and carried on with my day.

Fast forward a couple days to me talking to another coworker who was good friends with Brian. He says ""Did you hear what happened to Brian?""

""Yeah he was in the hospital and was fired or something""

""Do you know why though?""

""No, he said it was personal""

So this is what happened a couple months ago before Brian disappeared. He was at home by himself, when his neighbours (surprise) start yelling at him through the walls for being too loud. Brian telling himself ""I've had enough"" decides to call the police and have them deal with it. The police arrived and started talking to the neighbours for quite some time. Hours go by with the police and neighbours. So he calls the police again to ask what's taking so long. The police respond with ""..um.. We left like an hour and a half ago.""

Turns out that the neighbours were never yelling at him. In fact, they were never there. Brian was schizophrenic and was hearing voices in his head. He had to go to a mental hospital for a month.",1584630788,That was not how I expected this to end.,18156

She was good enough to be a Level 3 or Level 4 employee but never took the offer because she was a single mom, relied on public transportation, etc. 
Her friend, P, started at the same time she did and was a Level 3, working up to a Level 4. P & G were all good, until P discovered that G made more than P because she was constantly getting merit raises and performance bonuses.

One day, G made an honest mistake (our client just switched to a different protocol for billing and she accidentally did it the old way). It was a no harm, no foul situation but P went to the Level 4 employees and senior management and suggested that G be fired. They all went to HR who said that while there was no valid reason to fire her, they could move her to a shittier team that would basically guarantee her failure.

G realized what was happening and secured another job. We were going to be off for four days for Christmas, and G quit Thursday by leaving an after-hours voicemail. G knew that the message wouldn't be received until Monday morning so she sent out an email to the entire building, timed to be sent at 11:59 Christmas Eve. The email detailed how P was having an affair with her BIL while her husband was deployed, how one senior manager took this job because he was fired for embezzlement and lost his CPA license, and how one of our male Level 3 employees requested a transfer because our married department manager was sexually harassing him. 

We got in at 8; HR and IT got in at 9. It was a shitshow Monday morning. Quite a few people quit that day. And to think, it all could have been avoided.

Edit 1: Thanks for the award!

Edit 2: I've run into G and P since then. G is THRIVING. She got a stern phone call from the company and they tried to withhold her last paycheck but that was it. P is, well, a little more humble now. She was going through some serious shit at the time, and while that doesn't excuse any of the shit that she did, I think the letter was a wakeup call that she needed to fix her life.

t1_fpo9thz,20380,t3_gekt3w,beepborpimajorp,AskReddit,"A lot of hobby fish importing is pretty shady. You have farms of certain types of fish like bettas in some areas of the world that are run with the fish in horrible conditions. Which is why a lot of the ones you get in a major chain store are sick before you even bring them home. The stores will blame the fish being stressed, but I've ordered and received hundreds of fish from small breeders/sellers and outside of cory catfish that really enjoy committing suiciding by poisoning their own water, the fish arrive healthy and fine. 

Outside of boutique fish farming, the way some wild fish are caught is just horrible. The trappers will lightly poison the water supply to knock out the fish, then scoop them out of the water without a care for that area's ecosystem. This has led to depletion of some natural species to the point they are now endangered. 

Lastly, boutique fish sellers/major chains do not give half a rat's ass what happens to the fish in the end. This means that people who buy fish like plecos, bettas, goldfish, etc. end up getting sick of them and dumping them in local waterways to supposedly get rid of the problem. So in some areas, these fish have completely destroyed the local water ecology because, like other invasive land species, they were never meant to be there. One of the worst offenders is the lionfish in florida. It's venomous and has no natural predators so its population has exploded out of control.

the same is true of plecos:

https://youtu.be/V1_lcprYp5U

and goldfish:

https://youtu.be/fzXiUxwGGIM

basically releasing fish into the wild is a terrible idea. releasing any animal into the wild can have disastrous consequences, but fish are being released into a very limited ecosystem and outside of a few diseases, if they can adapt to the water and have no predators they will survive and breed incredibly quickly.

ETA: I've been trying to reply to everyone's questions, but there's a lot of them, so I'll just answer the most common ones here.

I still have asthma, but it has been well-managed for years now. I take Zenhale every day and Ventolin as needed.
  
I've been no contact with my mother for over a decade. She's a narcissist who not only emotionally abused me but encouraged my older brother to do so as well. This lead to him physically and sexually abusing me, and when I eventually confronted her on this, she said it was my fault for ""being such a bitch."" I cut her out of my life and that's made a world of difference for my mental health. Obviously no contact with brother either.

I am still in contact with my father (they divorced in my early 20s). We aren't close, but I still find enough value in the relationship to keep talking to him. He isn't actively cruel like my mother was, just lost in his own world, I guess you could say. I feel sorry for him that he hasn't managed to overcome his own demons the way that I have.

Overall, I am happy and healthy now. I have a lovely husband, and we've created a good life for ourselves. I do have C-PTSD from the years of abuse I lived through, but therapy and proper medication have helped tremendously. 

Thank you to everyone for your kind words. They mean a lot. :)",1617982513,That‚Äôs savage! I had to be put on a nebuliser at least once a year due to hay fever related asthma. Not fun. Hope yours ain‚Äôt too bad now :),258

I remember repeating those same sentiments and no one ever corrected me. In first grade, we were all assigned pen pals from a school in another city and mine was a Black girl named Chardonnay. I thought she had a weird name and I was disappointed when I found out she wasn't white.

Very soon after that, we learned some very basic info about the civil rights movement during Black history month. Martin Luther King Jr, Rosa Parks, separate water fountains, segregated schools, stuff like that. After that, I felt really bad about being racist and wanting a different pen pal, and really ashamed of my dad and grandparents for thinking that way. And I was so mad that they'd taught me to think that way. After that, I was really happy to have the opportunity to write to my pen pal and get to know her better.

My father accepted because he had noone else and his parents were pressing him to get married already.

But the highlight of the story is that over some time, the two of them fell in love with each other. Their love only grew over the time and they were really happy together. My mother spent her last days very ill, and she would accept only my father by her bedside. He swears to this day that she was an angel sent from god to take care of him.
